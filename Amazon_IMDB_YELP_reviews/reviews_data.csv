Warning - Stay away.	0	Amazon
I wish I could return the unit and get back my money.	0	Amazon
Awsome Device Works Great!!.	1	Amazon
I used to talk on it for 1 - 1 1/2 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying.	0	Amazon
If you don't find it, too bad, as again the unit comes with one earpad only.I would not recommend this to anyone.	0	Amazon
Very Displeased.	0	Amazon
I might have gotten a defect, but I would not risk buying it again because of the built quality alone.	0	Amazon
They made this case too small and is very difficult to install.	0	Amazon
Restored my phone to like new performance.	1	Amazon

Does not fit.	0	Amazon
Very happy with this product.	1	Amazon
The screen size is big, key pad lit well enough, and the camera quality is excellent for a camera phone.	1	Amazon
There's really nothing bad I can say about this headset.	0	Amazon
i'm glad i found this product on amazon it is hard to find, it wasn't high priced.	1	Amazon
Portable and it works.	1	Amazon
My colleague & I now get great reception.A little expensive, but performance is great.	1	Amazon

I have had TMobile service for 2 or 3 years now, and I am pretty happy with it.	1	Amazon

Very easy to use.	1	Amazon
Uncomfortable In the Ear, Don't use with LG VX9900 (EnV).	0	Amazon

It holds a charge for a long time, is reasonably comfortable under long-wearing conditions and the quality of sound is tremendous.	1	Amazon
I'd like to return it.	0	Amazon
The keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough I don't expect any problems.	1	Amazon
Verizon's bills, however, are difficult to understand even though their pricing plans are simple.	0	Amazon
After charging overnight, these batteries work great.	1	Amazon
You won't regret it!	1	Amazon
I love this phone!.	1	Amazon
A Disappointment.	0	Amazon
Its not user friendly.	0	Amazon
Unfortunately the ability to actually know you are receiving a call is a rather important feature and this phone is pitiful in that respect.	0	Amazon
Then I exchanged for the same phone, even that had the same problem.	0	Amazon
This results in the phone being either stuck at max volume or mute.	0	Amazon
This PDA rocks.	1	Amazon
It is super charged up for use as a small hybrid palmtop/camera/cellphone, and excels in those roles.	1	Amazon
I would definitely recommend the Jabra BT250v for those who are looking for comfort, clarity and a great price!	1	Amazon
I had Verizon 2 years ago and really liked their service.	1	Amazon

The holster that arrived did not match the photo in the ad.	0	Amazon
great...no problems at all!.	1	Amazon
As an earlier review noted, plug in this charger and nothing happens.	0	Amazon

You never know if you pushed it hard enough or the right number of times for the function you want or not.	0	Amazon
The sound is clear and the people I talk to on it are amazed at the quality too.	1	Amazon
I got the aluminum case for my new Palm VX and it worked really well--it has protected my handheld perfectly so far.	1	Amazon

Mobile Phone Tools are a must have.	1	Amazon
I am very impressed with the job that Motorola did on the sturdiness of this phone.	1	Amazon

The phone is sturdy and waterproof.	1	Amazon
I am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone.	0	Amazon
My only complaint is the standard sound volume is a little low even when turned up to 5(of 5)	0	Amazon
Thanks again to Amazon for having the things I need for a good price!	1	Amazon
I ended up sliding it on the edge of my pants or back pockets instead.	1	Amazon

No real improvement.	0	Amazon
Razr Battery - Good buy.	1	Amazon
Keep up the good work Amazon!!	1	Amazon
They refuse to refund or replace.	0	Amazon
Unfortunately it's easy to accidentally activate them with the gentle-touch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening.	0	Amazon
So I basically threw my money out the window for nothing.	0	Amazon
Great case and price!	1	Amazon
All it took was one drop from about 6 inches above the kitchen counter and it was cracked.I am not impressed and I am not laughing.	0	Amazon
Bluetooth range is good - a few days ago I left my phone in the trunk, got a call, and carried the conversation without a hitch.	1	Amazon
Small, sleek, impressive looking, practical setup with ample storage in place.	1	Amazon
The eargels channel the sound directly into your ear and seem to increase the sound volume and clarity.	1	Amazon
none of the new ones have ever quite worked properly.	0	Amazon
I am glad I purchased it.	1	Amazon
I've missed numerous calls because of this reason.	0	Amazon
Perhaps my phone is defective, but people cannot hear me when I use this.	0	Amazon
Don't buy this product.	0	Amazon
sucked, most of the stuff does not work with my phone.	0	Amazon
No shifting, no bubbling, no peeling, not even a scratch, NOTHING!I couldn't be more happier with my new one for the Droid.	1	Amazon
Worst software ever used.... If I could give this zero stars I would.	0	Amazon
Trying to make a call on these is an exercise in frustration.	0	Amazon
The case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever.	0	Amazon
I own a Jabra Earset and was very happy with it, but the sound quality, especially outgoing, on this is better.	1	Amazon
I love the camera, it's really pretty good quality.	1	Amazon
Thank you for such great service.	1	Amazon
Its a total package.	1	Amazon
The seller is very understanding and patient, I would definitely buy from them again.	1	Amazon
I give Wirefly 1 star.I will contact Cingular/AT&T; and inform them of this practice.	0	Amazon

Virgin Wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone!	1	Amazon
None of it works, just don't buy it.	0	Amazon
Muddy, low quality sound, and the casing around the wire's insert was poorly super glued and slid off.	0	Amazon
Please dont waste your money.	0	Amazon
All in all, I'm quite satisfied with this purchase.	1	Amazon
If you are looking for a good quality Motorola Headset keep looking, this isn't it.	0	Amazon
Yet Plantronincs continues to use the same flawed charger design.	0	Amazon

"I can barely ever hear on it and am constantly saying ""what?"""	0	Amazon
The battery life is highly unacceptable.	0	Amazon
That company is a joke.	0	Amazon
It does everything the description said it would.	1	Amazon
Due to this happening on every call I was forced to stop using this headset.	0	Amazon
It works great with a car charger, especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time.	1	Amazon
Verizon tech support walked my through a few procedures, none of which worked and I ended up having to do a hard re-set, wiping out all my data.	0	Amazon
Voice Quality, Signal Strength, Dropped Calls.	0	Amazon
It plays louder than any other speaker of this size; the price is so low that most would think the quality is lacking, however, it's not.	1	Amazon
Better than expected.	1	Amazon
It feels poorly constructed, the menus are difficult to navigate, and the buttons are so recessed that it is difficult to push them.	0	Amazon
Battery is holding up well.	1	Amazon
Also difficult to put on.I'd recommend avoiding this product.	0	Amazon
I only used it two days, and it wasn't always easy to hear with.	0	Amazon

Piece of trash.	0	Amazon
A pretty good product.	1	Amazon
This is a great phone!.	1	Amazon
For the price on Amazon, it is an excellent product, which I would highly recommend.	1	Amazon
Their Research and Development division obviously knows what they're doing.	1	Amazon
The real killer is the volume, and of course it breaking.	0	Amazon
Those phones are working just fine now.	1	Amazon
I am more than happy with this product.	1	Amazon
Poor Construction.	0	Amazon
This is infuriating.	0	Amazon
Overall, I would recommend this phone over the new Walkman.	1	Amazon
Sprint charges for this service.	0	Amazon
It is cheap, and it feel and look just as cheap.	0	Amazon
It fits my ear well and is comfortable on.	1	Amazon
It doesn't work in Europe or Asia.	0	Amazon
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cent's up-and-coming.	1	Amazon
I like design and look of Jabra behing the ear headsets and 5020 is pretty comfortible to wear 24 hours a day without pain in the ear.	1	Amazon
I was amazed at the quick arrival of the two original lg cell phone batteries and and at a fraction of the price.	1	Amazon
the worst phone from samsung...crap..... this crappy Samsung E715.. is the worst i have ever seeen.	0	Amazon
the charger worked for about a week and then completely stopped charging my phone.	0	Amazon
Poor product.	0	Amazon
However I needed some better instructions.	0	Amazon
You need two hands to operate the screen.This software interface is decade old and cannot compete with new software designs.	0	Amazon
Worked very well paired with a Treo 700w and as a Skype headset on my PC (using a USB Bluetooth transceiver).	1	Amazon
Steer clear of this product and go with the genuine Palm replacementr pens, which come in a three-pack.	0	Amazon
DO NOT BUY DO NOT BUYIT SUCKS	0	Amazon
This is a great product..... sure beats using your fingers!.	1	Amazon
Plus, I seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point.	0	Amazon
All the other cases I've tried normally fall apart after a few months but this one seems to be in for the long haul.	1	Amazon
Very Dissapointing Performance.	0	Amazon
Don't make the same mistake that I did and please don't buy this phone.	0	Amazon
This phone might well be the worst I've ever had in any brand.	0	Amazon
Case was more or less an extra that I originally put on but later discarded because it scratched my ear.	0	Amazon
I recommend iGo to anyone with different brand cell phones/mp3 players in the family.	1	Amazon
Don't bother - go to the store.	0	Amazon
I posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone, but i have the Fire Red and it's a great color!	1	Amazon
I did not have any problem with this item and would order it again if needed.	1	Amazon
You get what you pay for I guess.	0	Amazon
Not only did the software do a great job of this, I could also make my own ringtones form my existing CDs without an internet connection.	1	Amazon
im surprised this is a good quality car charger and there's not much reviews about it.	1	Amazon
These are fabulous!	1	Amazon
However, BT headsets are currently not good for real time games like first-person shooters since the audio delay messes me up.	0	Amazon
I used bitpim (a free program you can find on the internet)to transfer data to the phone.The price of the cable was excellent.	1	Amazon
Disappointing accessory from a good manufacturer.	0	Amazon
Performed awful -- muffled, tinny incoming sound and severe echo for those on the other end of the call.	0	Amazon
Very wind-resistant.	1	Amazon
Obviously they have a terrible customer service, so you get what you pay for.	0	Amazon
They do not last forever, but is not overly expensive to replace.Easy to operate and the sound is much better than others I have tried.	1	Amazon
I contacted the company and they told me that, although the unit was still under warranty, if I couldn't produce my receipt I was out of luck.	0	Amazon
Linksys should have some way to exchange a bad phone for a refurb unit or something!	0	Amazon
Phone is sturdy as all nokia bar phones are.	1	Amazon

When I placed my treo into the case, not only was it NOT snug, but there was A LOT of extra room on the sides.	0	Amazon
I'm pleased.	1	Amazon
Battery is terrible.	0	Amazon
I found the product to be easy to set up and use.	1	Amazon
The earpiece on this is too large or too heavy...it keeps falling out of my ear.	0	Amazon
Utter crap.. Sound quality is TERRIBLE.	0	Amazon
The charger arrived within the promised timeframe, but it did not work.	0	Amazon
No ear loop needed, it's tiny and the sound is great.	1	Amazon
Finally, after three or four times the spring of the latch broke and I could not use it any longer on the visor.	0	Amazon
The handsfree part works fine, but then the car tries to download the address book, and the Treo reboots.Overall, I still rate this device high.	1	Amazon
Talk about USELESS customer service.	0	Amazon
"It felt too light and ""tinny.""."	0	Amazon
This does not fit the Palm Tungsten E2 and it broke the first time I tried to plug it in.	0	Amazon
I'm happy about this purchase- good quality and low price.	1	Amazon
I love the look and feel of Samsung flipphones.	1	Amazon
Its well-designed and very sharp -- the blue is a very nice color.	1	Amazon
Does everything it should and more.	1	Amazon
I could not recommend these more.	0	Amazon
Nice Sound.	1	Amazon
Looks good in the picture, but this case was a huge disappointment!!	0	Amazon
Much less than the jawbone I was going to replace it with.	1	Amazon
Setup went very smoothly.	1	Amazon
its extremely slow and takes forever to do anything with it.	0	Amazon
"A must study for anyone interested in the ""worst sins"" of industrial design."	0	Amazon
The first thing that happened was that the tracking was off.	0	Amazon
It is well made, easy to access the phone and has a handy, detachable belt clip.	1	Amazon
Then I had to continue pairing it periodically since it somehow kept dropping.	0	Amazon
Can't upload ringtones from a third party.	0	Amazon
Bluetooth does not work, phone locks up, screens just flash up and now it just makes calls randomly while in my pocket locked.	0	Amazon
Truly awful.	0	Amazon
It works fine on my Motorola 325 cellphone, and a lot better than the worn-out battery did.	1	Amazon
The volume for the ringer is REAL good (you have choices how loud).	1	Amazon
And none of the tones is acceptable.	0	Amazon
camera color balance is AWFUL.	0	Amazon
This product is clearly not ready for prime time, I don't care how cool it looks, if you can't tell a call is coming in it's worthless.	0	Amazon
I love the ringtones because they are so upbeat!	1	Amazon
Chinese Forgeries Abound!.	0	Amazon
Easy to pair with my Samsung Cell.	1	Amazon
The instructions didn't explain that a microphone jack could be used.	0	Amazon
i would advise to not purchase this item it never worked very well.	0	Amazon
Too bad you have to pay up to $$$ a month for the service!	0	Amazon
Works well.	1	Amazon
The nokia CA-42 USB cable did not work with my phone.	0	Amazon
Clear crisp sound.	1	Amazon
I have to use the smallest earpieces provided, but it stays on pretty well.	1	Amazon
The biggest complaint I have is, the battery drains superfast.	0	Amazon
The design might be ergonomic in theory but I could not stand having these in my ear.	0	Amazon
Do NOT buy if you want to use the holster.	0	Amazon
The phone can also take great pictures and even video clips.	1	Amazon
It doesn't make you look cool.	0	Amazon
Because both ears are occupied, background is not distracting at all.	1	Amazon
Comfortable fit - you need your headset to be comfortable for at least an hour at a time, if not for an entire day.	1	Amazon
Also, the phone doesn't seem to accept anything except CBR mp3s, preferably ripped by Windows Media Player.	0	Amazon
You can't beat the price on these.	1	Amazon
* Comes with a strong light that you can use to light up your camera shots, and even flash SOS signals (seriously!	1	Amazon
lightweight and works well.	1	Amazon
So just beware.	0	Amazon
I love this cable - it allows me to connect any mini-USB device to my PC.	1	Amazon
So anyone near you will hear part of your conversation.	0	Amazon
This is cool because most cases are just open there allowing the screen to get all scratched up.	1	Amazon
I bought this phone as a replacement for my StarTac and have regretted it since.	0	Amazon
Appears to actually outperform the original battery from China that came with my V325i.	1	Amazon
Can't store anything but phone numbers to SIM.	0	Amazon
It lasts less than 3o minutes, if I actually try to use the phone.My wife has the same phone with the same problem.	0	Amazon
Poor quality.	0	Amazon
"jabra ear gels ""R"" the best!."	1	Amazon
Not worth it.	0	Amazon
The phone crashed completely and now I have to get it replaced.	0	Amazon
It quit working after I'd used it for about 18 months, so I just purchased another one because this is the best headset I've ever owned.	1	Amazon
Unfortunately it will not recharge my iPhone 4s, despite connecting it from multiple power sources (iMac, external battery, wall outlet, etc).	0	Amazon
It was a great phone.	1	Amazon
if you simply want a small flip phone -- look elsewhere as the extra bells & whistles are mediocre.	0	Amazon
Good value, works fine - power via USB, car, or wall outlet.	1	Amazon
My phone doesn't slide around my car now and the grip prevents my phone from slipping out of my hand.	1	Amazon
This is simply the BEST bluetooth headset for sound quality!	1	Amazon
Think it over when you plan to own this one!This sure is the last MOTO phone for me!	0	Amazon
"In the span of an hour, I had two people exclaim ""Whoa - is that the new phone on TV?!?"	1	Amazon
I have always used corded headsets and the freedom from the wireless is very helpful.	1	Amazon
This case has passed the one year mark and while it shows signs of wear, it is 100% functional.	1	Amazon
Other than that, the leather is nice and soft; the fit is very tight; the cut out for the face is a good shape.	1	Amazon
It has everything I need and I couldn't ask for more.	1	Amazon
After receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke.	0	Amazon
This product is great... it makes working a lot easier I can go to the copier while waiting on hold for something.	1	Amazon
None of the three sizes they sent with the headset would stay in my ears.	0	Amazon

It is light, has plenty of battery capacity, and is very confortable to wear for somewhat extended periods of time.	1	Amazon
disappointing.	0	Amazon
Blue Ant is easy to use.	1	Amazon
Cheap but hey it works.. Was pleasantly suprised given the low cost of this item.	1	Amazon
The camera on the phone may be used as a dustpan when indoors... I'd rather be using a disposable then this.	0	Amazon
Then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use.	0	Amazon
It's very convenient and simple to use - gets job done & makes the car ride so much smoother.	1	Amazon

After my phone got to be about a year old, it's been slowly breaking despite much care on my part.	0	Amazon
I am sorry I made this purchase.	0	Amazon
I bought these hoping I could make my Bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear.	0	Amazon
Treo and T-Mobile refused to replace it again and forced me to buy another phone without any kind of upgrade discount.	0	Amazon
It was horrible!.	0	Amazon
I don't think it would hold it too securly on your belt.	0	Amazon
This allows the possibility of double booking for the same date and time after the first.	0	Amazon
They work about 2 weeks then break.	0	Amazon
It is simple to use and I like it.	1	Amazon
It's a great tool for entertainment, communication, and data management.Oh, be sure to use ActiveSync 4.2 for optimal data synchronization results!	1	Amazon
I can't use this case because the smell is disgusting.	0	Amazon
NOT WHAT I WANTED.	0	Amazon
I own 2 of these cases and would order another.	1	Amazon

$50 Down the drain.	0	Amazon

Terrible phone holder.	0	Amazon
The cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly.	1	Amazon
I love being able to use one headset for both by land-line and cell.	1	Amazon
Problem is that the ear loops are made of weak material and break easily.	0	Amazon
Not nearly as good looking as the AMAZON picture makes it look.	0	Amazon
But despite these few flaws, this case is of exceptional quality and well worth the additional costs of owning an official OEM product.	1	Amazon
How stupid is that?	0	Amazon
I can hear while I'm driving in the car, and usually don't even have to put it on it's loudest setting.	1	Amazon
Seller shipped quickly and much cheaper than the competitors.	1	Amazon
Good show, Samsung.	1	Amazon

My phone sounded OK ( not great - OK), but my wife's phone was almost totally unintelligible, she couldn't understand a word being said on it.	0	Amazon

A very, very, very slow-moving, aimless movie about a distressed, drifting young man.  	0	IMDB
Not sure who was more lost - the flat characters or the audience, nearly half of whom walked out.  	0	IMDB
Attempting artiness with black & white and clever camera angles, the movie disappointed - became even more ridiculous - as the acting was poor and the plot and lines almost non-existent.  	0	IMDB
Very little music or anything to speak of.  	0	IMDB
The best scene in the movie was when Gerardo is trying to find a song that keeps running through his head.  	1	IMDB
The rest of the movie lacks art, charm, meaning... If it's about emptiness, it works I guess because it's empty.  	0	IMDB
Wasted two hours.  	0	IMDB
Saw the movie today and thought it was a good effort, good messages for kids.  	1	IMDB
A bit predictable.  	0	IMDB

"This is a very ""right on case"" movie that delivers everything almost right in your face.  "	1	IMDB
It had some average acting from the main person, and it was a low budget as you clearly can see.  	0	IMDB
This review is long overdue, since I consider A Tale of Two Sisters to be the single greatest film ever made.  	1	IMDB
I'll put this gem up against any movie in terms of screenplay, cinematography, acting, post-production, editing, directing, or any other aspect of film-making.  	1	IMDB
"It's practically perfect in all of them  a true masterpiece in a sea of faux ""masterpieces.  "	1	IMDB
""" The structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema.  "	1	IMDB
I can think of no other film where something vitally important occurs every other minute.  	1	IMDB
In other words, the content level of this film is enough to easily fill a dozen other films.  	1	IMDB
How can anyone in their right mind ask for anything more from a movie than this?  	1	IMDB
It's quite simply the highest, most superlative form of cinema imaginable.  	1	IMDB
Yes, this film does require a rather significant amount of puzzle-solving, but the pieces fit together to create a beautiful picture.  	1	IMDB
This short film certainly pulls no punches.  	0	IMDB
Graphics is far from the best part of the game.  	0	IMDB
This is the number one best TH game in the series.  	1	IMDB

It's PURE BRILLIANCE.  	1	IMDB
This was a flick doomed from its conception.  	0	IMDB
The very idea of it was lame - take a minor character from a mediocre PG-13 film, and make a complete non-sequel while changing its tone to a PG-rated family movie.  	0	IMDB
I wasn't the least bit interested.  	0	IMDB
Not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic, but it also managed to give away the ENTIRE movie; and I'm not exaggerating - every moment, every plot point, every joke is told in the trailer.  	0	IMDB
But it's just not funny.  	0	IMDB
But even the talented Carrell can't save this.  	0	IMDB
His co-stars don't fare much better, with people like Morgan Freeman, Jonah Hill, and Ed Helms just wasted.  	0	IMDB
The story itself is just predictable and lazy.  	0	IMDB
The only real effects work is the presence of all the animals, and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious blue/green-screen work I've ever seen.  	0	IMDB
But whatever it was that cost them so much, it didn't translate to quality, that's for sure.  	0	IMDB
The film succeeds despite, or perhaps because of, an obviously meagre budget.  	1	IMDB
I'm glad the film didn't go for the most obvious choice, as a lesser film certainly would have.  	1	IMDB
In addition to having one of the most lovely songs ever written, French Cancan also boasts one of the cutest leading ladies ever to grace the screen.  	1	IMDB
It's hard not to fall head-over-heels in love with that girl.  	1	IMDB
On the negative, it's insipid enough to cause regret for another 2 hours of life wasted in front of the screen.  	0	IMDB
Long, whiny and pointless.  	0	IMDB
But I recommend waiting for their future efforts, let this one go.  	0	IMDB
Excellent cast, story line, performances.  	1	IMDB
Totally believable.  	1	IMDB
Anne Heche was utterly convincing.  	1	IMDB
Sam Shepard's portrayal of a gung ho Marine was sobering.  	1	IMDB
I sat riveted to the TV screen.  	1	IMDB
All in all I give this one a resounding 9 out of 10.  	1	IMDB
I do think Tom Hanks is a good actor.  	1	IMDB
I enjoyed reading this book to my children when they were little.  	1	IMDB
I was very disappointed in the movie.  	0	IMDB
One character is totally annoying with a voice that gives me the feeling of fingernails on a chalkboard.  	0	IMDB
There is a totally unnecessary train/roller coaster scene.  	0	IMDB
There was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters.  	0	IMDB
This movie totally grates on my nerves.  	0	IMDB
The performances are not improved by improvisation, because the actors now have twice as much to worry about: not only whether they're delivering the line well, but whether the line itself is any good.  	0	IMDB
And, quite honestly, often its not very good.  	0	IMDB
Often the dialogue doesn't really follow from one line to another, or fit the surroundings.  	0	IMDB
It crackles with an unpredictable, youthful energy - but honestly, i found it hard to follow and concentrate on it meanders so badly.  	0	IMDB
There are some generally great things in it.  	1	IMDB
I wouldn't say they're worth 2 hours of your time, though.  	0	IMDB
The suspense builders were good, & just cross the line from G to PG.  	1	IMDB
I especially liked the non-cliche choices with the parents; in other movies, I could predict the dialog verbatim, but the writing in this movie made better selections.  	1	IMDB
If you want a movie that's not gross but gives you some chills, this is a great choice.  	1	IMDB

I gave it a 10  	1	IMDB
The Wind and the Lion is well written and superbly acted.  	1	IMDB
It is a true classic.  	1	IMDB
It actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as B-list horror/suspense films go.  	1	IMDB

The problem was the script.  	0	IMDB
It was horrendous.  	0	IMDB

MANNA FROM HEAVEN is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time.  	1	IMDB
The scenes are often funny and occasionally touching as the characters evaluate their lives and where they are going.  	1	IMDB
The cast of veteran actors are more than just a nostalgia trip.  	1	IMDB
Ursula Burton's portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church.  	1	IMDB
"If you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast, some good music(including a Shirley Jones rendition of ""The Way You Look Tonight""), and an uplifting ending, give this one a try.  "	1	IMDB

Frankly, after Cotton club and Unfaithful, it was kind of embarrassing to watch Lane and Gere in this film, because it is BAD.  	0	IMDB
The acting was bad, the dialogs were extremely shallow and insincere.  	0	IMDB
It was too predictable, even for a chick flick.  	0	IMDB
Too politically correct.  	0	IMDB
Very disappointing.  	0	IMDB
The only thing really worth watching was the scenery and the house, because it is beautiful.  	1	IMDB
I love Lane, but I've never seen her in a movie this lousy.  	0	IMDB
An hour and a half I wish I could bring back.  	0	IMDB
But in terms of the writing it's very fresh and bold.  	1	IMDB
The acting helps the writing along very well (maybe the idiot-savant sister could have been played better), and it is a real joy to watch.  	1	IMDB
The directing and the cinematography aren't quite as good.  	0	IMDB
The movie was so boring, that I sometimes found myself occupied peaking in the paper instead of watching (never happened during a Columbo movie before!  	0	IMDB
), and sometimes it was so embarrassing that I had to look away.  	0	IMDB
The directing seems too pretentious.  	0	IMDB
"The scenes with the ""oh-so-mature"" neighbour-girl are a misplace.  "	0	IMDB
And generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode.  	0	IMDB
Then scene where they debated whether or not to sack the trumpeter (who falsely was accused for the murder) is pure horror, really stupid.  	0	IMDB
"Some applause should be given to the ""prelude"" however.  "	1	IMDB
I really liked that.  	1	IMDB
A great film by a great director.  	1	IMDB

I'd advise anyone to go and see it.  	1	IMDB
Brilliant!  	1	IMDB
10/10  	1	IMDB

My only problem is I thought the actor playing the villain was a low rent Michael Ironside.  	0	IMDB
It rocked my world and is certainly a must see for anyone with no social or physical outlets.  	1	IMDB
However, this didn't make up for the fact that overall, this was a tremendously boring movie.  	0	IMDB
There was NO chemistry between Ben Affleck and Sandra Bullock in this film, and I couldn't understand why he would consider even leaving his wife-to-be for this chick that he supposedly was knocked out by.  	0	IMDB
There were several moments in the movie that just didn't need to be there and were excruciatingly slow moving.  	0	IMDB
"This was a poor remake of ""My Best Friends Wedding"".  "	0	IMDB

"I cannot believe that the actors agreed to do this ""film"".  "	0	IMDB
I could not stand to even watch it for very long for fear of losing I.Q.  	0	IMDB
I guess that nobody at the network that aired this dribble watched it before putting it on.  	0	IMDB
IMDB ratings only go as low 1 for awful, it's time to get some negative numbers in there for cases such as these.  	0	IMDB
"I saw ""Mirrormask"" last night and it was an unsatisfactory experience.  "	0	IMDB

All the pretty pictures in the world cannot make up for a piece of work that is flawed at the core.  	0	IMDB
It is an hour and half waste of time, following a bunch of very pretty high schoolers whine and cry about life.  	0	IMDB
You can't relate with them, hell you barely can understand them.  	0	IMDB
This is definitely a cult classic well worth viewing and sharing with others.  	1	IMDB

It was a good thing that the tickets only cost five dollars because I would be mad if I'd have paid $7.50 to see this crap.  	0	IMDB
NOBODY identifies with these characters because they're all cardboard cutouts and stereotypes (or predictably reverse-stereotypes).  	0	IMDB
This is a bad film, with bad writing, and good actors....an ugly cartoon crafted by Paul Haggis for people who can't handle anything but the bold strokes in storytelling....a picture painted with crayons.  	0	IMDB
Crash is a depressing little nothing, that provokes emotion, but teaches you nothing if you already know racism and prejudice are bad things.  	0	IMDB

An excellent performance from Ms.  	1	IMDB
Garbo, who showed right off the bat that her talents could carry over from the silent era (I wanted to see some of her silent work, but Netflix doesn't seem to be stocking them.  	1	IMDB

But other than that the movie seemed to drag and the heroes didn't really work for their freedom.  	0	IMDB

This is definitely one of the bad ones.  	0	IMDB
The movie I received was a great quality film for it's age.  	1	IMDB
John Wayne did an incredible job for being so young in the movie industry.  	1	IMDB
His on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him.  	1	IMDB
I think that it is a must see older John Wayne film.  	1	IMDB
I really don't see how anyone could enjoy this movie.  	0	IMDB
I don't think I've ever seen a movie half as boring as this self-indulgent piece of junk.  	0	IMDB
It probably would have been better if the director hadn't spent most of the movie showcasing his own art work, which really isn't that noteworthy.  	0	IMDB
Another thing I didn't really like is when a character got punched in the face, a gallon of blood would spew forth soon after.  	0	IMDB
Jamie Foxx absolutely IS Ray Charles.  	1	IMDB
His performance is simply genius.  	1	IMDB
"He owns the film, just as Spacek owned ""Coal Miner's Daughter"" and Quaid owned ""Great Balls of Fire.  "	1	IMDB
""" In fact, it's hard to remember that the part of Ray Charles is being acted, and not played by the man himself.  "	1	IMDB
Ray Charles is legendary.  	1	IMDB
Ray Charles' life provided excellent biographical material for the film, which goes well beyond being just another movie about a musician.  	1	IMDB
Hitchcock is a great director.  	1	IMDB
Ironically I mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch.  	0	IMDB
Secondly, Hitchcock pretty much perfected the thriller and chase movie.  	1	IMDB
It's this pandering to the audience that sabotages most of his films.  	0	IMDB
Hence the whole story lacks a certain energy.  	0	IMDB
The plot simply rumbles on like a machine, desperately depending on the addition of new scenes.  	0	IMDB
There are the usual Hitchcock logic flaws.  	0	IMDB
Mishima is extremely uninteresting.  	0	IMDB
This is a chilly, unremarkable movie about an author living/working in a chilly abstruse culture.  	0	IMDB
The flat reenactments don't hold your attention because they are emotionally adrift and stagy.  	0	IMDB
And the rest of it just sits there being awful... with soldiers singing songs about the masculinity they pledge themselves to, hairsplitting about purity, the admiration of swords, etc.  	0	IMDB
He can bore you to pieces, and kill the momentum of a movie, quicker than anyone else.  	0	IMDB
Schrader has made a resume full of lousy, amateurish films.  	0	IMDB
When I first watched this movie, in the 80s, I loved it.  	1	IMDB
I was totally fascinated by the music, the dancing... everything.  	1	IMDB
However, I recently watched the whole thing again on DVD, and I was completely struck by how extremely stupid the storyline was - how it contained holes, inconsistencies and - frankly - a whole lot of crap - and how horrid the dancing was.  	0	IMDB
I mean, in a realistic world, she would NEVER have gotten into that ballet repertory... The whole thing was quite pathetic.  	0	IMDB
The character developments also lacked in depth.  	0	IMDB
Woa, talk about awful.  	0	IMDB
Do not waste your time.  	0	IMDB
It was just too horrible.  	0	IMDB
The worst, sappiest dialogue... I could go on and on.  	0	IMDB
But what really made it unwatchable was the direction.  	0	IMDB
The poor actors.  	0	IMDB
You can't even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action.  	0	IMDB
If you check the director's filmography on this site you will see why this film didn't have a chance.  	0	IMDB
This would not even be good as a made for TV flick.  	0	IMDB
If good intentions made a film great, then this film might be one of the greatest films ever made.  	1	IMDB
The film has great actors, a master director, a significant theme--at least a would-be significant theme, undertone of fifties existential world-weariness, aerial scenes that ought to have thrilled both senses and imagination, and characters about which one might deeply care.  	1	IMDB
Regrettably, the film fails.  	0	IMDB
The movie lacks visual interest, drama, expression of feeling, and celebration of the very patriotism that underlines the narrative.  	0	IMDB
No actress has been worse used that June Allison in this movie.  	0	IMDB

I came out of it feeling angry.  	0	IMDB
***SPOILERS*** Whatever else can (or can't) be said about it, SURFACE is superbly crafted.  	1	IMDB
The cinematography is simply stunning (to say the least) and the fx are nothing if not state-of-the-art.  	1	IMDB
Conceptually, the show offers a little bit of everything- and for just about everybody (parents, kids, fantasy and/or fx fans).  	1	IMDB
And there wasn't a single sour note struck acting-wise, either; some surprisingly solid casting, here.  	1	IMDB
All things considered, a job very well done.  	1	IMDB
Thanks good a movie like this was done and released.  	1	IMDB
One of the best mexican movies ever!, and one of the less understood, even by mexican themselves, no matter how identified the should have felt with it.  	1	IMDB
It ranks highly as a great noir-crime-drama, incredible performances by Belmondo and Lino Ventura.  	1	IMDB
The attention given to every character, and complex psychological portrayals, detailing loyalty, treachery, love, and hope, are tremendous.  	1	IMDB
It is an excellent drama, an excellent thriller, and an excellent film.  	1	IMDB
Up there with the best of Melville.  	1	IMDB

BLACK WATER is a thriller that manages to completely transcend it's limitations (it's an indie flick) by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience.  	1	IMDB
The performances are real and gripping, the crocdodile is extremely well done, indeed if the Black Water website is to be believed that's because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous.  	1	IMDB
I thoroughly enjoyed it when Christopher Eccleston took control of the TARDIS and the continuation of the series.  	1	IMDB

An AMAZING finale to possibly the BEST trilogy of all time!  	1	IMDB
Kieslowski never ceases to amaze me.  	1	IMDB
He is one of my favourite directors, and one of the most talented directors in the history of cinema.  	1	IMDB
His use of the colours of the French flag in the three films was nothing short of incredible, every shot, every scene was like a work of art.  	1	IMDB
Three of the most visually appealing movies i've ever seen.  	1	IMDB
And his subtle connections between the three films are awesome.  	1	IMDB
I have to mention this and it is a huge SPOILER, i loved the ending, how all the characters of the three films were the remaining survivors of the ferry disaster, with Valentine and the young judge together, and the old man watching it on her TV, solidifying his happiness over the suffering which he dealt with for those many years.  	1	IMDB
I couldn't think of a better way to end the film, but a smile on my face, great way to wrap up an amazing film and trilogy!  	1	IMDB
I recommend this for EVERYONE who loves film, movies, anything...A Work of Art!  	1	IMDB
10 out of 10 for both the movie and trilogy.  	1	IMDB

"But when someone strives for greatness and poetry, but delivers a muddled (and often ridiculous) story, a bunch of disparate scenes, pretentious dialogue... Then you get the worst kind of a movie that some other reviewer very accurately defined as ""pretentious crap"".  "	0	IMDB

One more thing: I can tolerate political incorrectness very well, I'm all for artistic freedom and suspension of disbelief, but the Slavic female character was just too much.  	0	IMDB

The things that the four kids get themselves into is absolutely hilarious to watch.  	1	IMDB

"I think the most wonderful parts (literally, full of ""wonder"") are the excerpts from his works.  "	1	IMDB
The sets (especially designed to work with the camera) are amazing....stylized, beautiful and effective.  	1	IMDB

The stories were powerful explorations of the nature of man and of art.  	1	IMDB

I highly recommend this movie for anyone interested in art, poetry, theater, politics, or Japanese history.  	1	IMDB
Here, in The Wind and the Lion, we see a wonderful rendering of America's own Imperial age.  	1	IMDB
) What makes this story different are the terrific production values - faultless photography, composition and editing - the terrific casting - the underappreciated Brian Keith playing a bully Teddy - and vivid history.  	1	IMDB
"Though The Wind and the Lion is told largely through the eyes of the son, every member of the family can identify with one of the characters, whether it be Sean Connery's noble brigand, Candace Bergen's feisty heroine, John Huston's wily John Hay or Steve Kanaly's spiffy, radiant, ruthless can-do lieutenant, Roosevelt's ""Big Stick"".

This is high adventure at its best.  	1	IMDB
I think it was Robert Ryans best film, because he portrayed someone like my father, and he was a schizophrenic in real life,(my father) although he never murdered anyone but was affected more so during the second world war which made him worse.  	1	IMDB
Having to humour him just to get by and get through the day was so apt.  	1	IMDB
(My mother and brother had to do this)When I saw Robert Ryan portraying this type of man, it was a very good imitation of this type of individual, and I was impressed.  	1	IMDB
Almost all of the songs in Cover Girl are old-fashioned and not very tuneful.  	0	IMDB
The most annoying thing about 'Cover Girl' is the way in which Rita Hayworth is put up on a pedestal.  	0	IMDB
Unfortunately, 'Cover Girl' is an example of how Hollywood used to exploit women for financial gain.  	0	IMDB
Non-linear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well.  	1	IMDB

The sets are so bad, they wouldn't look out of place on a Thunderbirds episode.  	0	IMDB
The use of slow-motion needlessly repeats itself throughout the movie but is well backed up by bad acting (and bad is a kind word here), no continuity, scenes that are thrown in for no reason whatsoever, vehicles that looked like they were made from a Corn Flakes box and a directorial style that bordered on stupidity.  	0	IMDB
Oh yeah, and the storyline was pathetic too.  	0	IMDB

An interesting premise, and Billy Drago is always good as a dangerous nut-bag (side note: I'd love to see Drago, Stephen McHattie and Lance Hendrikson in a flick together; talk about raging cheekbones!).  	1	IMDB
The soundtrack wasn't terrible, either.  	1	IMDB
But the acting--even that of such professionals as Drago and Debbie Rochon--was terrible, the directing worse (perhaps contributory to the former), the dialog chimp-like, and the camera work, barely tolerable.  	0	IMDB
"Still, it was the SETS that got a big ""10"" on my ""oy-vey"" scale.  "	1	IMDB
Yes, I am simplifying things here for the sake of brevity, for this really is at the core of the problems with this film - it has too much going on without any real, fulfilling explanation.  	0	IMDB

The plot, such as it is, is so derivative and predictable that the ending is like a mercy killing.  	0	IMDB
The awful dialogue and hopeless overacting by everyone who gets shot top off a real waste of space and time.  	0	IMDB
I was very uneasy with how bad this movie was, but not scared at all.  	0	IMDB
The dialogue is composed of things that make little sense.  	0	IMDB
About 30 minutes of footage is wasted to show mediocre elderly actors awkwardly babbling overwrought pseudo-Satanic gibberish corny enough to make a teen Goth blush, almost always in Olde English, and sometimes in Latin that may or may not be made up words.  	0	IMDB
The directing is sloppy at best.  	0	IMDB
Hackneyed writing, certainly, but made even worse by the bad directing.  	0	IMDB
Of course, the acting is blah.  	0	IMDB
The acting by the whole cast could be put on a scale and balanced perfectly between overacting and underacting.  	0	IMDB

I loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had it's share of ups and down, but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other.  	1	IMDB
I have seen many movies starring Jaclyn Smith, but my god this was one of her best, though it came out 12 years ago.  	1	IMDB

What this film lacks is a convincing script.  	0	IMDB
The script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed.  	0	IMDB
Things happen, characters personalities change, plot twists occur for no real reason other than that script calls for it.  	0	IMDB
The cast is good.  	1	IMDB

20th Century Fox's ROAD HOUSE 1948) is not only quite a silly noir but is an implausible unmitigated bore of a movie.  	0	IMDB
Full of unconvincing cardboard characters it is blandly written by Edward Chodorov, who also produced, and is surprisingly directed by Jean Negulesco from whom one would expect a great deal more.  	0	IMDB
From here on the Widmark character turns unintentionally comical!  	0	IMDB
His losing his marbles so early in the proceedings is totally implausible and unconvincing.  	0	IMDB

add betty white and jean smart and you have a great cast - everyone played their parts really well.  	1	IMDB

first of all, there are enough racial stereotypes and racial jokes to offend everyone.  	0	IMDB
the movie is littered with overt racial slurs towards the black cast members and in return the whites are depicted as morons and boobs.  	0	IMDB

STEAMBOAT WILLIE is an amazingly important film to our cinema history.  	1	IMDB
This second appearance of Mickey Mouse (following the silent PLANE CRAZY earlier that year) is probably his most famous film--mostly because it was so ground-breaking.  	1	IMDB
While you don't yet hear Mickey speak, there are tons of sound effects and music throughout the film--something we take for granted now but which was a huge crowd pleaser in 1928.  	1	IMDB
However, after seeing the short again after about 25 years, I was amazed at how timeless the film actually is.  	1	IMDB
"It's just adorable seeing Mickey playing ""Turkey in the Straw"" in a highly imaginative (if occasionally cruel) way.  "	1	IMDB
Clever and a real crowd-pleaser--this film still ranks among Mickey's best films even after 80 wonderful years.  	1	IMDB
The bipolarity of the ruthless thug (one minute a ruthless killer, the next minute a Luv's diaper commercial) is completely unconvincing.  	0	IMDB

It's a shame to see good actors like Thomerson and James make a living in a mess like this.  	0	IMDB
I thought it was bad.  	0	IMDB
Both films are terrible, but to the credit of the 1986 version, it was watchable.  	0	IMDB
Let's start with all the problemsthe acting, especially from the lead professor, was very, very bad.  	0	IMDB
The script is a big flawed mess.  	0	IMDB
The best example of how dumb the writing is when it's established that you can turn the zombie-students back into humans by removing a necklace containing a piece of the meteorite.  	0	IMDB
"Director Paul Matthews, who also wrote/directed the weak 1995 monster movie ""Grim"", clearly doesn't know how to pace his films.  "	0	IMDB
The movie is terribly boring in places.  	0	IMDB
The lighting is awful.  	0	IMDB
The film looks cheap and bland.  	0	IMDB
One of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of notable gore.  	0	IMDB
This convention never worked well in the past, and certainly doesn't work here.  	0	IMDB

He is almost unbearable to watch on screen, he has little to no charisma, and terrible comedic timing.  	0	IMDB
Aside from it's terrible lead, this film has loads of other debits.  	0	IMDB
I understand that it's supposed to be a cheap popcorn comedy, but that doesn't mean that it has to completely insult our intelligence, and have writing so incredibly hackneyed that it borders on offensive.  	0	IMDB
Lewis Black's considerable talent is wasted here too, as he is at his most incendiary when he is unrestrained, which the PG-13 rating certainly won't allow.  	0	IMDB
The film's sole bright spot was Jonah Hill (who will look almost unrecognizable to fans of the recent Superbad due to the amount of weight he lost in the interim).  	1	IMDB
With the originality and freshness of the first movie now spent, this remake had little else to offer.  	0	IMDB
The budget was evidently very limited.  	0	IMDB
This was reflected not only in the cast, but also in the below-par script, which borrowed much from the earlier classic.  	0	IMDB
However, here there was no decent acting, action or location work to balance things up.  	0	IMDB
Filmiing was less expansive.  	0	IMDB
It failed to convey the broad sweep of landscapes that were a great part of the original.  	0	IMDB
Generally; it just lacked imagination.  	0	IMDB

I can't believe there's even a sequel to this!  	0	IMDB
Which is precisely why I am giving it such a bad review!  	0	IMDB
Being a 90's child, I truly enjoyed this show and I can proudly say that I enjoyed it big time and even more than the classical WB cartoons.  	1	IMDB
"But ""Tiny Toons"" kept the 90's vibe and delivered one of the most popular, funny, and underrated cartoons ever created.  "	1	IMDB
The memories are murky but I can only say that I enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show.  	1	IMDB
Easily, none other cartoon made me laugh in a tender way (before getting into dark sitcoms oriented for teenagers).  	1	IMDB
The characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character.  	1	IMDB
Every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead.  	1	IMDB
Every element of this story was so over the top, excessively phony and contrived that it was painful to sit through.  	0	IMDB

There is simply no excuse for something this poorly done.  	0	IMDB
I saw this movie and I thought this is a stupid movie.  	0	IMDB
What is even more stupid is that who had thought an idea that there should be a volcano in Los Angeles?  	0	IMDB
To be honest with you, this is unbelievable nonsense and very foolish.  	0	IMDB
In conclusion, I will not bother with this movie because a volcano in Los Angeles is nothing but nonsense.  	0	IMDB
The story line is just awful!  	0	IMDB
It's just painful!  	0	IMDB
And the accents are absolutely abysmal!  	0	IMDB

An instant classic, with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits.  	1	IMDB
Don't miss it.  	1	IMDB
This is a masterful piece of film-making, with many themes simmering and occasionally boiling over in this warts and all study of the poet's bohemian, self-indulgent wartime years that span the aerial bombardments of London and the outward tranquillity of a Welsh coastal retreat - the borderlines between friendship, lust and love, dedication to art and experience versus practical concerns, jealousy, rivalry, cowardice and egotism versus heroism and self-sacrifice and more.  	1	IMDB
A mature, subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances (apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that Keira Knightley is prone to, though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it).  	1	IMDB
But above all the exquisite visual composition of each moment, with inventive and elegant use of close-up, camera angle and lighting, including pointillistic faux home movie footage, is a wonder and joy to behold.  	1	IMDB
It's as continuously beautiful to look at as a Bertolucci, but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that master's work.  	1	IMDB
The basic premise is wasted since it is sidelined by the inexplicable focus on the documentary crew.  	0	IMDB
Regardless, the film fails on most levels.  	0	IMDB
Avoid at all costs.  	0	IMDB

But it wasn't until I watched this film that I realised how great he actually was.  	1	IMDB
I'll give this film 10 out of 10!  	1	IMDB
I know that Jim O'Connor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him, but George was well dull.  	0	IMDB
He really didn't seem to want to be hosting; his voice-overs were monotonous, didn't get involved with the guests.  	0	IMDB
Lovely little thriller from Hitchcock, with lots of nice shenanigans surrounding a murdered spy, a kidnapped child, a nasty church, a foreign plot and some random taxidermists.  	1	IMDB
Jimmy Stewart is as ever a great hero for Hitchcock, the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function, but it lacks the brooding menace of Hitchcock's black and white, low-budget original.  	1	IMDB
Nevertheless yet another wonderful film from the great master's stable.  	1	IMDB
I have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film!  	1	IMDB
Excellently produced by one of Sci-fi's best producers Scot Vandiver !  	1	IMDB

This movie is so mind-bendingly awful, it couldn't have even been created.  	0	IMDB

This movie does an excellent job of revealing the complexity of the task and the incredible challenges facing South Africa.  	1	IMDB

Very true to Shakespear, and a 'must' for all Shakespear fans.  	1	IMDB
Macbeth (Jason Connery) moved me to tears with his final monolog (out brief candle, out)He gave the sphere of moral decay and dark forces a human face, which makes it the more interesting.  	1	IMDB
Helen Baxendale is a very credible lady Macbeth who can be very cheerfull at times and sometimes she just looks like a naughty girl, but deadly in her taste for blood and evil.  	1	IMDB
If you love death and decay, and Shakespears lyrics... this is the one.  	1	IMDB
This is a witty and delightful adaptation of the Dr Seuss book, brilliantly animated by UPA's finest and thoroughly deserving of its Academy Award.  	1	IMDB

"However Paul Schrader has indeed made a film ""about"" Mishima that is both superb & complex.  "	1	IMDB
Also notable is John Bailey's fine crisp beautifully colored cinematography and the great production design & costumes by Eiko Ishioka who went on to do the memorable costumes for Coppola's Dracula for which she received a well deserved Oscar.  	1	IMDB
Even allowing for poor production values for the time (1971) and the format (some kind of mini-series), this is baaaaaad.  	0	IMDB

It felt like a very gripping, intelligent stage play (but without the overly theatrical feeling one actually gets from watching people on a stage) which plays on everyone's terror of a white lie escalating to monstrous consequences.  	1	IMDB

It has a very good plot, it holds your complete attention, the acting is superb, Tom Wilkinson was fantastic and Emily Watson was also very good.  	1	IMDB
A very good film indeed, about great and unconditional love.  	1	IMDB
Tom Wilkinson's character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin, but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses, and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the character's anguish and suffering.  	1	IMDB
Emily Watson's character is very strong, and she has only to give a quick glance and you understand everything.  	1	IMDB
Despite the pans of reviewers, I liked this movie.  	1	IMDB

Technically, the film is well made with impressive camera-work, solid acting and effective music from Riz Ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like it's coming from a distant hill.  	1	IMDB
It's still wild stuff though and is highly recommended to fans of giallo cinema.  	1	IMDB

As a courtroom drama, it's compelling, as an indictment on the American justice system, it's frightening.  	1	IMDB
This film highlights the fundamental flaws of the legal process, that it's not about discovering guilt or innocence, but rather, is about who presents better in court.  	1	IMDB
The film is well paced, understated and one of the best courtroom documentaries I've seen.  	1	IMDB
This mostly routine fact-based TV drama gets a boost from the fine performance by Cole.  	1	IMDB
Predictable, but not a bad watch.  	1	IMDB
It was clear that she had the range and ability to pull off this part.  	1	IMDB
She carries the movie well.  	1	IMDB
Constantine gives everything the right intensity and seems to have a good understanding of the underlying psychological motivations.  	1	IMDB
It is wonderful and inspiring to watch, and I hope that it gets released again on to video or DVD.  	1	IMDB
How this piece of trash was ever released is beyond me: the acting, the story, the characters, the supposedly special effects, etc...it's ALL wrong.  	0	IMDB
In fact, this stinker smells like a direct-to-video release.  	0	IMDB
Avoid at ALL costs!  	0	IMDB
Star Trek V The final Frontier is the worst in the series.  	0	IMDB
The acting from all involved and that includes those like Shatner and Nimoy is bad and washed out and making them seem as old as they look in real life, the special effects are tacky like when Spock has to rescue Kirk on a jet pack when he falls down from a mountain.  	0	IMDB
The attempts at humor were pitiful and story is so awful it dosen't bear thinking about which basically involves a Vulcan stealing the Enterprise to find god (seriously) I just didn't care about any of this film and oh not to mention Uhura does a belly dance to distract male guards.  	0	IMDB
The only place good for this film is in the garbage.  	0	IMDB
The worst one of the series.  	0	IMDB
Editing: The editing of this film was phenomenal in my opinion.  	1	IMDB
When a song could explain the emotions of the subjects better, such as when Jay Adams' unfortunate life was a subject of talk, the song Old Man by Neil Young was played, which evokes many emotions.  	1	IMDB
Cinematography: The film was shot in an interesting way.  	1	IMDB
Of course the footage from the 70s was grainy, but that only enhanced the film.  	1	IMDB
This film offers many delights and surprises.  	1	IMDB
"When Achille and Philippa beautifully sing a duet from ""Don Giovanni"" that perfectly describes their situation in the movie, you appreciate the subtle layers of this excellent film.  "	1	IMDB
The story unfolds in 18th century Jutland and the use of period music played on period instruments is just one more fine touch.  	1	IMDB
You share General Loewenhielm's exquisite joy in his partaking of the Cailles en Sarcophage even though you are just watching a movie - but you do wish for just a small sample to savor.  	1	IMDB
But this understated film leaves a lasting impression.  	1	IMDB
The warmth it generates is in contrast to its austere backdrop.  	1	IMDB
You will leave the theater wanting to go out and dance under the stars.  	1	IMDB
The acting, as you'd expect from this cast, is top notch.  	1	IMDB
The characters are fleshed out surprisingly well, particularly Grimes and Blake, and all the actors deliver their sharply scripted lines with just the right amount of deadpan tongue in cheek to make the dialogue both hilarious and realistic.  	1	IMDB
Angus Scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing, violin-playing anatomist Doctor Quinn.  	1	IMDB
Conclusion - I loved it.  	1	IMDB
It's a long time since I was so entertained by a movie.  	1	IMDB
I struggle to find anything bad to say about it.  	1	IMDB
Mark my words, this is one of those cult films like Evil Dead 2 or Phantasm that people will still be discovering and falling in love with 20, 30, 40 years down the line.  	1	IMDB
It's pretty surprising that this wonderful film was made in 1949, as Hollywood generally had its collective heads in the sand concerning black and white issues at that time.  	1	IMDB
The film deserves strong kudos for taking this stand, for having exceptional acting from its mostly lesser-known cast and for the super-intelligent script that doesn't insult the audience or take the easy way out when it comes to white racism.  	1	IMDB
Plus, with the movie's rather modest budget and fast running time, it does an amazing job!  	1	IMDB
Juano Hernandez (an exceptional actor who played supporting roles in many films of the era) is a proud black man who is accused of murdering a white man in the South.  	1	IMDB

See it with your kids if you have a chance--it will open up some amazing dialog about how far race relations have come in the last 50 years.  	1	IMDB

"It was that year, however, that reminded us that Huston was still at the top of his game as evinced by his faithful adaptation of James Joyce's acclaimed novella ""The Dead.  "	1	IMDB
Feelings, thoughts...Gabriel's discomfort during the dance...all these intangibles leap to life and come within the viewer's grasp in Huston's portrayal.  	1	IMDB
Very disappointed and wondered how it could be in the Oscar shortlist.  	0	IMDB
It's very slow.  	0	IMDB
Lot of holes in the plot: there's nothing about how he became the emperor; nothing about where he spend 20 years between his childhood and mature age.  	0	IMDB

End of Days is one of the worst big-budget action movies I've ever seen.  	0	IMDB
He surely doesn't know how to make a coherent action movie from the screenwriter of Air Force One who was only obliged to write the script just for a big sum of money.  	0	IMDB
This was one of the worst films i have ever seen.  	0	IMDB
I'm still trying to get over how bad it was.  	0	IMDB
This movie is possibly one of the most creative works of horror ever.  	1	IMDB
It has everything you could want... suspense, drama, comedy, confusing subplots, native americans, brain eating... If you're looking for the be-all, end-all of brainsucking movies, look no further.  	1	IMDB
""" With great sound effects, and impressive special effects, I can't recommend this movie enough.  "	1	IMDB
Call me a nut, but I think this is one of the best movies ever.  	1	IMDB
Great character actors Telly Savalas and Peter Boyle.  	1	IMDB
1 hour 54 minutes of sheer tedium, melodrama and horrible acting, a mess of a script, and a sinking feeling of GOOD LORD, WHAT WERE THEY THINKING?  	0	IMDB
Lots of holes in the script.  	0	IMDB
It's like a bad two hour TV movie.  	0	IMDB
Now imagine that every single one of those decisions was made wrong.  	0	IMDB
The dialogue is atrocious.  	0	IMDB
The acting is beyond abysmal.  	0	IMDB
Everything stinks.  	0	IMDB
Trouble is, the writing and directing make it impossible to establish those things that make a movie watchable, like character, story, theme and so on.  	0	IMDB
Worse, there's an incredibly weak sub-plot thrown in that follows a little band of latter-day Mansonites as they go after a reporter who's working on a story on the anniversary of the killings.  	0	IMDB
It's dumb and pointless, and a complete waste of time.  	0	IMDB
In short, don't bother with this movie.  	0	IMDB
I won't spoil it, but the ending in pretty amazing.  	1	IMDB
The best scene in the movie is at the end, but I won't spoil it.  	1	IMDB
If there was ever an indication of a writer and a director's ability to meld two highly volatile temperaments into a seamless union of creativity, then this is it!  	1	IMDB
The result is a powerhouse achievement, made more timely now perhaps because of our culture's disturbing fascination with celebrity, and it's distorted interpretations of fame.  	1	IMDB
A film not easily forgotten.  	1	IMDB
But, Kevin Spacey is an excellent, verbal tsunami as Buddy Ackerman  and totally believable because he is a great actor.  	1	IMDB
The scripting of the subtle comedy is unmatched by any movie in recent years.  	1	IMDB
The characters are interesting, even if a bit predictable.  	1	IMDB
Highly recommended for all ages, although the younger set will probably not appreciate some of the more subtle references, they will certainly appreciate one galley scene in particular!  	1	IMDB
Great movie!  	1	IMDB
Also the story and acting were weak.  	0	IMDB
At around 4 pm I bought it, at around 8pm I started to watch, at around 8.15pm I fast forwarded the remaining film to see if there was anything left watchable for a human being with a brain... but there wasn't.  	0	IMDB
Either way, it sucks.  	0	IMDB
The script is horrendously stupid.  	0	IMDB
The story starts too fast with absolutely no suspense or build-up in the slightest.  	0	IMDB
Everything Captain Howdy says is either laughable or just plain stupid.  	0	IMDB
What the hell kind of crap is that?!  	0	IMDB
Then, there's the plot holes.  	0	IMDB
You could drive a semi truck into these holes!  	0	IMDB
Linda Cardellini is the only thing good in this film.  	1	IMDB
She's poised and amazing.  	1	IMDB
Dee Snider just plain sucks.  	0	IMDB
He can't act (one of the least scary villains I have ever seen), he can't write (did he write this damn movie in his sleep?  	0	IMDB
I was bored throughout the whole damn thing.  	0	IMDB
The acting sucks, the music sucks, the script sucks, the pacing sucks, the special FX suck, the directing sucks... basically, this movie sucks.  	0	IMDB
This film tries to be a serious and sophisticated thriller/horror flick and it fails miserably.  	0	IMDB
This is probably one of the least effective and utterly unoriginal films I have ever seen in my entire life.  	0	IMDB
A piece of cinematic garbage captured on celluloid.  	0	IMDB
Avoid at any and all costs.  	0	IMDB
At any rate this film stinks, its not funny, and Fulci should have stayed with giallo and supernatural zombie movies.  	0	IMDB
Avoid this film at all costs.  	0	IMDB
I don't know what happened in Season Five, what a mess.  	0	IMDB
The only consistent thread holding the series together were the amazing performances of Leni Parker and Anita LaSelva as the two Taelons in quiet idealogical conflict.  	0	IMDB
Now this is a movie I really dislike.  	0	IMDB
It's one of the most boring Horror movies from the 90's mainly because it starts slow and centers in a boring atmosphere.  	0	IMDB
The puppets look really cheesy , not in a good way like in the Puppet Master 80's flicks.  	0	IMDB
The story is lame, not interesting and NEVER really explains the sinister origins of the puppets.  	0	IMDB
There aren't death scenes like in previous movies and the f/x are terrible.  	0	IMDB
I felt asleep the first time I watched it, so I can recommend it for insomniacs.  	0	IMDB
The fact is, this film is a wonderful, heartwarming tale about two people chasing their dreams.  	1	IMDB
"The best part about ""Nurse Betty"" is it's unpredictability.  "	1	IMDB
Director Neil LaBute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality, and along with the touching drama, and hilarious comedy, you can never tell what is going to happen next.  	1	IMDB
Otherwise, don't even waste your time on this.  	0	IMDB
This one just fails to create any real suspense.  	0	IMDB
As for the killer, don't expect anything original or even remotely frightening.  	0	IMDB
There is, however, some pretty good acting (at least, for this type of film).  	1	IMDB
I'm so sorry but I really can't recommend it to anyone.  	0	IMDB
One of the most boring,pointless movies I have ever seen.  	0	IMDB
The secondary plot line is incomprehensible and its relation to the primary plot line is mystifying.  	0	IMDB

This is one of the worst Sandra Bullock movie since Speed 2 But not quite that bad.  	0	IMDB
I don't understand how this garbage got on the shelves of the movie store, it's not even a real movie!  	0	IMDB
I highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash.  	0	IMDB
This is not movie-making.  	0	IMDB
The acting is like watching wooden puppets moving around and reading from a book, that's how bad it is.  	0	IMDB
So I am here to warn you--DO NOT RENT THIS MOVIE, it is the dumbest thing you have never seen!  	0	IMDB
I saw this short film on HBO the other day and absolutely loved it.  	1	IMDB
I didn't realize how wonderful the short really is until the last two scenes.  	1	IMDB
Excellent short film.  	1	IMDB
Hopefully, the director James Cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast, or win us over with a whole new film.  	1	IMDB
I agree with Jessica, this movie is pretty bad.  	0	IMDB
Characters are one-dimensional, even the good guys and especially the bad guys.  	0	IMDB
The story line is totally predictable.  	0	IMDB
Not much dialogue, not much music, the whole film was shot as elaborately and aesthetically like a sculpture.  	1	IMDB
I've seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie.  	0	IMDB
Bad characters, bad story and bad acting.  	0	IMDB
Really awful.  	0	IMDB
Not easy to watch.  	0	IMDB
Funny, clever, hip - just like Pray's previous film, Hype!  	1	IMDB
It was a long time that i didn't see a so charismatic actor on screen.  	1	IMDB
Paolo Sorrentino has written a wonderful story about loneliness and Tony has built one of the most unforgettable characters seen in movies in recent years.  	1	IMDB
The movie is not completely perfect but 'Titta Di Girolamo' will stay with you for a long time after the vision of the movie.  	1	IMDB
I rate this movie 9/10.  	1	IMDB
I do not know if this was Emilio Estevez's directorial debut, but the pacing, the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character Estevez plays all suggest a natural eye.  	1	IMDB
The interplay between Martin and Emilio contains the same wonderful chemistry we saw in Wall Street with Martin and Charlie.  	1	IMDB
"Kathy Bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism; a variation on her character in ""At Play In The Fields Of The Lord"".  "	1	IMDB
For readers who have already seen one of Miyazaki's films: he is still in top form and made another worthwhile experience.  	1	IMDB
It never condescends, all the characters have good genuine hearts and believable problems.  	1	IMDB
The two main characters may be two of the most believable children I ever saw put on screen.  	1	IMDB
They are so easy to love, but even more easy to identify with.  	1	IMDB
This movie is great--especially if you enjoy visual arts.  	1	IMDB
The scenery that the two daughters paint and photograph are beautiful.  	1	IMDB
The story is also both funny and poignant at times.  	1	IMDB
"People who like European films and ""art movies"" will like this movie.  "	1	IMDB
This is truly an art movie--it actually has a lot of art in it.  	1	IMDB
Go rent it.  	1	IMDB
However, after finally watching this film, I realized that not only had I had a closed mind to the brilliance it depicts, I also found myself watching it over and over again.  	1	IMDB
It's the one movie that never ceases to interest me, simply because it keeps me alert, as I try to attempt to decipher it's meanings.  	1	IMDB
Brilliance indeed.  	1	IMDB
But if you liked movies like The Matrix (and better yet, their sequels) I think you'll appreciate the thought provoking, mindblowing experience this film will give you.  	1	IMDB
Think of the film being like a dream.  	1	IMDB
Simply beautiful.  	1	IMDB
Both Rickman and Stowe play their roles to the hilt in this tale of a childrens' book writer who-- maybe?-- has written a subversive tract.  	1	IMDB
It's a gloriously fun, fast paced and fairly accurate portrayal of the night of a raver.  	1	IMDB
It presents a idyllic yet serious portrayal of the ups and downs of the characters lives.  	1	IMDB
"Just whatever you do, avoid ""Groove"" as its the antithesis of all that is good about Human Traffic.  "	0	IMDB
It's too bad that everyone else involved didn't share Crowe's level of dedication to quality, for if they did, we'd have a far better film on our hands than this sub-par mess.  	0	IMDB
The movie seemed a little slow at first.  	0	IMDB
But it picked up speed and got right to the point.  	1	IMDB
"It showed exactly how the government and the scientist argued for humanity and the reasons of the ""gadget"".  "	1	IMDB
I enjoyed it.  	1	IMDB
I have recommended it to friends.  	1	IMDB
I was particularly pleased with the acting ability of Dwight Schultz.  	1	IMDB
Both actors truly understand and become their particular character, delivering a convincing, sincere performance.  	1	IMDB
Their on-screen chemistry, critical to the entire film, is genuine.  	1	IMDB
The film's dialogue is natural, real to life.  	1	IMDB
The writer, Gorman Bechard, undoubtedly did his homework because all references are industry and character-age appropriate.  	1	IMDB
The incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film.  	1	IMDB
Each track commands sentiment, actually contributing to the scenes and characters.  	1	IMDB
Definitely worth seeing it's the sort of thought provoking film that forces you to question your own threshold of loneliness.  	1	IMDB
"Hayao Miyazaki's latest and eighth film for Studio Ghibili, ""Gake No Ue No Ponyo"" (Ponyo on the Cliff by the Sea) is a wonderfully fun and imaginative look at childhood.  "	1	IMDB
At a time when it seems that film animation has been dominated by Disney/Pixar's CGI masterpieces, it is both refreshing and comforting to know that Miyazaki is still relying on traditional hand-drawn animation to tell his charming and enchanting stories.  	1	IMDB
Enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film.  	1	IMDB
The art style has the appearance of crayon/pencil drawings and is wonderfully colorful and fanciful.  	1	IMDB
If you act in such a film, you should be glad that you're gonna drift away from earth as far as possible!  	0	IMDB
This one wants to surf on the small wave of space movies in 1998 (Deep Impact and Armageddon), and this one fails everywhere.  	0	IMDB
If you haven't choked in your own vomit by the end (by all the cheap drama and worthless dialogue) you've must have bored yourself to death with this waste of time.  	0	IMDB
Still, it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost.  	1	IMDB
Just consider the excellent story, solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses.  	1	IMDB
Instead, we got a bore fest about a whiny, spoiled brat babysitting.  	0	IMDB
Then I watched it again two Sundays ago (March 20th, 2005) and I began to really enjoy it and this time I taped the entire thing.  	1	IMDB
It is a very well acted and done TV Movie.  	1	IMDB
Judith Light is one of my favorite actresses and I think she does a superb job in this film!  	1	IMDB
I keep watching it over and over.  	1	IMDB
It's a sad movie, but very good.  	1	IMDB
If you have not seen this movie, I definitely recommend it!  	1	IMDB
She is as lovely as usual, this cutie!  	1	IMDB
Still it's quite interesting and entertaining to follow.  	1	IMDB
;) Recommend with confidence!  	1	IMDB
This movie is well-balanced with comedy and drama and I thoroughly enjoyed myself.  	1	IMDB
It was a riot to see Hugo Weaving play a sex-obsessed gay real estate salesman who uses his clients' houses for his trysts with the flaming Darren (Tom Hollander).  	1	IMDB

Took an hour to get our food only 4 tables in restaurant my food was Luke warm, Our sever was running around like he was totally overwhelmed.	0	YELP
The worst was the salmon sashimi.	0	YELP
Also there are combos like a burger, fries, and beer for 23 which is a decent deal.	1	YELP
This was like the final blow!	0	YELP
I found this place by accident and I could not be happier.	1	YELP
seems like a good quick place to grab a bite of some familiar pub food, but do yourself a favor and look elsewhere.	0	YELP
Overall, I like this place a lot.	1	YELP
The only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive.	1	YELP
Ample portions and good prices.	1	YELP

Hard to judge whether these sides were good because we were grossed out by the melted styrofoam and didn't want to eat it for fear of getting sick.	0	YELP
On a positive note, our server was very attentive and provided great service.	1	YELP
Frozen pucks of disgust, with some of the worst people behind the register.	0	YELP
The only thing I did like was the prime rib and dessert section.	1	YELP

The burger is good beef, cooked just right.	1	YELP
If you want a sandwich just go to any Firehouse!!!!!	1	YELP
My side Greek salad with the Greek dressing was so tasty, and the pita and hummus was very refreshing.	1	YELP

The Heart Attack Grill in downtown Vegas is an absolutely flat-lined excuse for a restaurant.	0	YELP

Always a great time at Dos Gringos!	1	YELP

We got the food and apparently they have never heard of salt and the batter on the fish was chewy.	0	YELP
A great way to finish a great.	1	YELP
The deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks, and Jeff went above and beyond what we expected.	1	YELP
- Really, really good rice, all the time.	1	YELP
The service was meh.	0	YELP
It took over 30 min to get their milkshake, which was nothing more than chocolate milk.	0	YELP
I guess I should have known that this place would suck, because it is inside of the Excalibur, but I didn't use my common sense.	0	YELP
The scallop dish is quite appalling for value as well.	0	YELP
2 times - Very Bad Customer Service !	0	YELP
The sweet potato fries were very good and seasoned well.	1	YELP
Today is the second time I've been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good.	1	YELP
There is so much good food in Vegas that I feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to Rice and Company.	0	YELP
Coming here is like experiencing an underwhelming relationship where both parties can't wait for the other person to ask to break up.	0	YELP
walked in and the place smelled like an old grease trap and only 2 others there eating.	0	YELP
The turkey and roast beef were bland.	0	YELP
This place has it!	1	YELP
The pan cakes everyone are raving about taste like a sugary disaster tailored to the palate of a six year old.	0	YELP
I love the Pho and the spring rolls oh so yummy you have to try.	1	YELP
The poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying.	0	YELP

Omelets are to die for!	1	YELP
Everything was fresh and delicious!	1	YELP

On the up side, their cafe serves really good food.	1	YELP
Our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow, he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go!	1	YELP
The only good thing was our waiter, he was very helpful and kept the bloddy mary's coming.	1	YELP
Best Buffet in town, for the price you cannot beat it.	1	YELP
I LOVED their mussels cooked in this wine reduction, the duck was tender, and their potato dishes were delicious.	1	YELP
This is one of the better buffets that I have been to.	1	YELP
So we went to Tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon!	1	YELP
The food was delicious, our bartender was attentive and personable AND we got a great deal!	1	YELP
The ambience is wonderful and there is music playing.	1	YELP
Will go back next trip out.	1	YELP
Sooooo good!!	1	YELP
REAL sushi lovers, let's be honest - Yama is not that good.	0	YELP
At least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving, and it wasn't that busy.	0	YELP
This is a really fantastic Thai restaurant which is definitely worth a visit.	1	YELP
Nice, spicy and tender.	1	YELP
Good prices.	1	YELP
Check it out.	1	YELP
It was pretty gross!	0	YELP
I've had better atmosphere.	0	YELP
Kind of hard to mess up a steak but they did.	0	YELP
Although I very much liked the look and sound of this place, the actual experience was a bit disappointing.	0	YELP
I just don't know how this place managed to served the blandest food I have ever eaten when they are preparing Indian cuisine.	0	YELP
Worst service to boot, but that is the least of their worries.	0	YELP
Service was fine and the waitress was friendly.	1	YELP
The guys all had steaks, and our steak loving son who has had steak at the best and worst places said it was the best steak he's ever eaten.	1	YELP
We thought you'd have to venture further away to get good sushi, but this place really hit the spot that night.	1	YELP
Host staff were, for lack of a better word, BITCHES!	0	YELP
Bland... Not a liking this place for a number of reasons and I don't want to waste time on bad reviewing.. I'll leave it at that...	0	YELP
Phenomenal food, service and ambiance.	1	YELP
I wouldn't return.	0	YELP
Definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly, will return next time I'm in Vegas.	1	YELP
This place is way too overpriced for mediocre food.	0	YELP
Penne vodka excellent!	1	YELP
They have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich, a crispy chicken wrap, a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers.	1	YELP
The management is rude.	0	YELP
Delicious NYC bagels, good selections of cream cheese, real Lox with capers even.	1	YELP
Great Subway, in fact it's so good when you come here every other Subway will not meet your expectations.	1	YELP
I had a seriously solid breakfast here.	1	YELP
This is one of the best bars with food in Vegas.	1	YELP
He was extremely rude and really, there are so many other restaurants I would love to dine at during a weekend in Vegas.	0	YELP
My drink was never empty and he made some really great menu suggestions.	1	YELP
Don't do it!!!!	0	YELP
The waiter wasn't helpful or friendly and rarely checked on us.	0	YELP
My husband and I ate lunch here and were very disappointed with the food and service.	0	YELP
And the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and wasn't very tasty to me.	0	YELP
Nice blanket of moz over top but i feel like this was done to cover up the subpar food.	1	YELP
The bathrooms are clean and the place itself is well decorated.	1	YELP
The menu is always changing, food quality is going down & service is extremely slow.	0	YELP
The service was a little slow , considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace.	0	YELP
I give it 2 thumbs down	0	YELP
We watched our waiter pay a lot more attention to other tables and ignore us.	0	YELP
My fiancé and I came in the middle of the day and we were greeted and seated right away.	1	YELP
This is a great restaurant at the Mandalay Bay.	1	YELP
We waited for forty five minutes in vain.	0	YELP
Crostini that came with the salad was stale.	0	YELP
Some highlights : Great quality nigiri here!	1	YELP
the staff is friendly and the joint is always clean.	1	YELP
this was a different cut than the piece the other day but still wonderful and tender s well as well flavored.	1	YELP
I ordered the Voodoo pasta and it was the first time I'd had really excellent pasta since going gluten free several years ago.	1	YELP
this place is good.	1	YELP
Unfortunately, we must have hit the bakery on leftover day because everything we ordered was STALE.	0	YELP
I came back today since they relocated and still not impressed.	0	YELP
I was seated immediately.	1	YELP
Their menu is diverse, and reasonably priced.	1	YELP
Avoid at all cost!	0	YELP
Restaurant is always full but never a wait.	1	YELP
DELICIOUS!!	1	YELP
This place is hands-down one of the best places to eat in the Phoenix metro area.	1	YELP
So don't go there if you are looking for good food...	0	YELP
I've never been treated so bad.	0	YELP
Bacon is hella salty.	1	YELP
We also ordered the spinach and avocado salad; the ingredients were sad and the dressing literally had zero taste.	0	YELP
This really is how Vegas fine dining used to be, right down to the menus handed to the ladies that have no prices listed.	1	YELP
The waitresses are very friendly.	1	YELP
Lordy, the Khao Soi is a dish that is not to be missed for curry lovers!	1	YELP
Everything on the menu is terrific and we were also thrilled that they made amazing accommodations for our vegetarian daughter.	1	YELP
Perhaps I caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews, but I'm not inspired to go back.	0	YELP
The service here leaves a lot to be desired.	0	YELP
The atmosphere is modern and hip, while maintaining a touch of coziness.	1	YELP
Not a weekly haunt, but definitely a place to come back to every once in a while.	1	YELP
We literally sat there for 20 minutes with no one asking to take our order.	0	YELP
The burger had absolutely no flavor - the meat itself was totally bland, the burger was overcooked and there was no charcoal flavor.	0	YELP
I also decided not to send it back because our waitress looked like she was on the verge of having a heart attack.	0	YELP
I dressed up to be treated so rudely!	0	YELP
It was probably dirt.	0	YELP
Love this place, hits the spot when I want something healthy but not lacking in quantity or flavor.	1	YELP
I ordered the Lemon raspberry ice cocktail which was also incredible.	1	YELP
The food sucked, which we expected but it sucked more than we could have imagined.	0	YELP
Interesting decor.	1	YELP
What I really like there is the crepe station.	1	YELP
Also were served hot bread and butter, and home made potato chips with bacon bits on top....very original and very good.	1	YELP
you can watch them preparing the delicious food!)	1	YELP
Both of the egg rolls were fantastic.	1	YELP
When my order arrived, one of the gyros was missing.	0	YELP
I had a salad with the wings, and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfied.	1	YELP
I'm not really sure how Joey's was voted best hot dog in the Valley by readers of Phoenix Magazine.	0	YELP
The best place to go for a tasty bowl of Pho!	1	YELP
The live music on Fridays totally blows.	0	YELP
I've never been more insulted or felt disrespected.	0	YELP
Very friendly staff.	1	YELP
It is worth the drive.	1	YELP
I had heard good things about this place, but it exceeding every hope I could have dreamed of.	1	YELP
Food was great and so was the serivce!	1	YELP
The warm beer didn't help.	0	YELP
Great brunch spot.	1	YELP
Service is friendly and inviting.	1	YELP
Very good lunch spot.	1	YELP
I've lived here since 1979 and this was the first (and last) time I've stepped foot into this place.	0	YELP
The WORST EXPERIENCE EVER.	0	YELP
Must have been an off night at this place.	0	YELP
The sides are delish - mixed mushrooms, yukon gold puree, white corn - beateous.	1	YELP
If that bug never showed up I would have given a 4 for sure, but on the other side of the wall where this bug was climbing was the kitchen.	0	YELP
For about 10 minutes, we we're waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasn't coming any time soon.	0	YELP
My friend loved the salmon tartar.	1	YELP
Won't go back.	0	YELP
Extremely Tasty!	1	YELP
Waitress was good though!	1	YELP
Soggy and not good.	0	YELP
The Jamaican mojitos are delicious.	1	YELP
Which are small and not worth the price.	0	YELP
- the food is rich so order accordingly.	1	YELP
The shower area is outside so you can only rinse, not take a full shower, unless you don't mind being nude for everyone to see!	0	YELP
The service was a bit lacking.	0	YELP
Lobster Bisque, Bussell Sprouts, Risotto, Filet ALL needed salt and pepper..and of course there is none at the tables.	0	YELP
Hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in.	0	YELP
It was either too cold, not enough flavor or just bad.	0	YELP
I loved the bacon wrapped dates.	1	YELP
This is an unbelievable BARGAIN!	1	YELP
The folks at Otto always make us feel so welcome and special.	1	YELP
"As for the ""mains,"" also uninspired."	0	YELP
This is the place where I first had pho and it was amazing!!	1	YELP
This wonderful experience made this place a must-stop whenever we are in town again.	1	YELP
If the food isn't bad enough for you, then enjoy dealing with the world's worst/annoying drunk people.	0	YELP
Very very fun chef.	1	YELP
Ordered a double cheeseburger & got a single patty that was falling apart (picture uploaded) Yeah, still sucks.	0	YELP
Great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with TV's.	1	YELP
If it were possible to give them zero stars, they'd have it.	0	YELP
"The descriptions said ""yum yum sauce"" and another said ""eel sauce"", yet another said ""spicy mayo""...well NONE of the rolls had sauces on them."	0	YELP
I'd say that would be the hardest decision... Honestly, all of M's dishes taste how they are supposed to taste (amazing).	1	YELP
If she had not rolled the eyes we may have stayed... Not sure if we will go back and try it again.	0	YELP
Everyone is very attentive, providing excellent customer service.	1	YELP
Horrible - don't waste your time and money.	0	YELP
Now this dish was quite flavourful.	1	YELP
By this time our side of the restaurant was almost empty so there was no excuse.	0	YELP
(It wasn't busy either) Also, the building was FREEZING cold.	0	YELP
"like the other reviewer said ""you couldn't pay me to eat at this place again."""	0	YELP
-Drinks took close to 30 minutes to come out at one point.	0	YELP
Seriously flavorful delights, folks.	1	YELP
Much better than the other AYCE sushi place I went to in Vegas.	1	YELP
The lighting is just dark enough to set the mood.	1	YELP
Based on the sub-par service I received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business I won't be going back.	0	YELP
Owner's are really great people.!	1	YELP
There is nothing privileged about working/eating there.	0	YELP
The Greek dressing was very creamy and flavorful.	1	YELP
Overall, I don't think that I would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that I silently felt too.	0	YELP
Now the pizza itself was good the peanut sauce was very tasty.	1	YELP
We had 7 at our table and the service was pretty fast.	1	YELP
Fantastic service here.	1	YELP
I as well would've given godfathers zero stars if possible.	0	YELP
They know how to make them here.	1	YELP
very tough and very short on flavor!	0	YELP
I hope this place sticks around.	1	YELP
I have been in more than a few bars in Vegas, and do not ever recall being charged for tap water.	0	YELP
The restaurant atmosphere was exquisite.	1	YELP
Good service, very clean, and inexpensive, to boot!	1	YELP
The seafood was fresh and generous in portion.	1	YELP
Plus, it's only 8 bucks.	1	YELP
The service was not up to par, either.	0	YELP
Thus far, have only visited twice and the food was absolutely delicious each time.	1	YELP
Just as good as when I had it more than a year ago!	1	YELP
For a self proclaimed coffee cafe, I was wildly disappointed.	0	YELP
The Veggitarian platter is out of this world!	1	YELP
You cant go wrong with any of the food here.	1	YELP
You can't beat that.	1	YELP
Stopped by this place while in Madison for the Ironman, very friendly, kind staff.	1	YELP
The chefs were friendly and did a good job.	1	YELP
I've had better, not only from dedicated boba tea spots, but even from Jenni Pho.	0	YELP
I liked the patio and the service was outstanding.	1	YELP
The goat taco didn't skimp on the meat and wow what FLAVOR!	1	YELP
I think not again	0	YELP
I had the mac salad and it was pretty bland so I will not be getting that again.	0	YELP
I went to Bachi Burger on a friend's recommendation and was not disappointed.	1	YELP
Service stinks here!	0	YELP
I waited and waited.	0	YELP
This place is not quality sushi, it is not a quality restaurant.	0	YELP
I would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza.	1	YELP
Great Pizza and Salads!	1	YELP
Things that went wrong: - They burned the saganaki.	0	YELP
We waited an hour for what was a breakfast I could have done 100 times better at home.	0	YELP
This place is amazing!	1	YELP
I hate to disagree with my fellow Yelpers, but my husband and I were so disappointed with this place.	0	YELP
Waited 2 hours & never got either of our pizzas as many other around us who came in later did!	0	YELP
Just don't know why they were so slow.	0	YELP
The staff is great, the food is delish, and they have an incredible beer selection.	1	YELP
I live in the neighborhood so I am disappointed I won't be back here, because it is a convenient location.	0	YELP
I didn't know pulled pork could be soooo delicious.	1	YELP
You get incredibly fresh fish, prepared with care.	1	YELP
Before I go in to why I gave a 1 star rating please know that this was my third time eating at Bachi burger before writing a review.	0	YELP
I love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it.	1	YELP
Never again will I be dining at this place!	0	YELP
The food was excellent and service was very good.	1	YELP
Good beer & drink selection and good food selection.	1	YELP
Please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles.	0	YELP
The potato chip order was sad... I could probably count how many chips were in that box and it was probably around 12.	0	YELP
Food was really boring.	0	YELP
Good Service-check!	1	YELP
This greedy corporation will NEVER see another dime from me!	0	YELP
Will never, ever go back.	0	YELP
As much as I'd like to go back, I can't get passed the atrocious service and will never return.	0	YELP
In the summer, you can dine in a charming outdoor patio - so very delightful.	1	YELP
I did not expect this to be so good!	1	YELP
Fantastic food!	1	YELP
She ordered a toasted English muffin that came out untoasted.	0	YELP
The food was very good.	1	YELP
Never going back.	0	YELP
Great food for the price, which is very high quality and house made.	1	YELP
The bus boy on the other hand was so rude.	0	YELP
By this point, my friends and I had basically figured out this place was a joke and didn't mind making it publicly and loudly known.	0	YELP
Back to good BBQ, lighter fare, reasonable pricing and tell the public they are back to the old ways.	1	YELP
And considering the two of us left there very full and happy for about $20, you just can't go wrong.	1	YELP
All the bread is made in-house!	1	YELP
The only downside is the service.	0	YELP
Also, the fries are without a doubt the worst fries I've ever had.	0	YELP
Service was exceptional and food was a good as all the reviews.	1	YELP
A couple of months later, I returned and had an amazing meal.	1	YELP
Favorite place in town for shawarrrrrrma!!!!!!	1	YELP
The black eyed peas and sweet potatoes... UNREAL!	1	YELP
You won't be disappointed.	1	YELP
They could serve it with just the vinaigrette and it may make for a better overall dish, but it was still very good.	1	YELP
I go to far too many places and I've never seen any restaurant that serves a 1 egg breakfast, especially for $4.00.	0	YELP
When my mom and I got home she immediately got sick and she only had a few bites of salad.	0	YELP
The servers are not pleasant to deal with and they don't always honor Pizza Hut coupons.	0	YELP
Both of them were truly unbelievably good, and I am so glad we went back.	1	YELP
We had fantastic service, and were pleased by the atmosphere.	1	YELP
Everything was gross.	0	YELP
I love this place.	1	YELP
Great service and food.	1	YELP
First - the bathrooms at this location were dirty- Seat covers were not replenished & just plain yucky!!!	0	YELP
"The burger... I got the ""Gold Standard"" a $17 burger and was kind of disappointed."	0	YELP
OMG, the food was delicioso!	1	YELP
There is nothing authentic about this place.	0	YELP
the spaghetti is nothing special whatsoever.	0	YELP
Of all the dishes, the salmon was the best, but all were great.	1	YELP
The vegetables are so fresh and the sauce feels like authentic Thai.	1	YELP
It's worth driving up from Tucson!	1	YELP
The selection was probably the worst I've seen in Vegas.....there was none.	0	YELP
Pretty good beer selection too.	1	YELP
This place is like Chipotle, but BETTER.	1	YELP
Classy/warm atmosphere, fun and fresh appetizers, succulent steaks (Baseball steak!!!!!	1	YELP
5 stars for the brick oven bread app!	1	YELP
I have eaten here multiple times, and each time the food was delicious.	1	YELP
We sat another ten minutes and finally gave up and left.	0	YELP
He was terrible!	0	YELP
Everyone is treated equally special.	1	YELP
It shouldn't take 30 min for pancakes and eggs.	0	YELP
It was delicious!!!	1	YELP
On the good side, the staff was genuinely pleasant and enthusiastic - a real treat.	1	YELP
Sadly, Gordon Ramsey's Steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to Vegas.	0	YELP
As always the evening was wonderful and the food delicious!	1	YELP
Best fish I've ever had in my life!	1	YELP
(The bathroom is just next door and very nice.)	1	YELP
The buffet is small and all the food they offered was BLAND.	0	YELP
This is an Outstanding little restaurant with some of the Best Food I have ever tasted.	1	YELP
Pretty cool I would say.	1	YELP
Definitely a turn off for me & i doubt I'll be back unless someone else is buying.	0	YELP
Server did a great job handling our large rowdy table.	1	YELP
I find wasting food to be despicable, but this just wasn't food.	0	YELP
My wife had the Lobster Bisque soup which was lukewarm.	0	YELP
Would come back again if I had a sushi craving while in Vegas.	1	YELP
The staff are great, the ambiance is great.	1	YELP
He deserves 5 stars.	1	YELP
I left with a stomach ache and felt sick the rest of the day.	0	YELP
They dropped more than the ball.	0	YELP
The dining space is tiny, but elegantly decorated and comfortable.	1	YELP
They will customize your order any way you'd like, my usual is Eggplant with Green Bean stir fry, love it!	1	YELP
And the beans and rice were mediocre at best.	0	YELP
Best tacos in town by far!!	1	YELP
I took back my money and got outta there.	0	YELP
In an interesting part of town, this place is amazing.	1	YELP
RUDE & INCONSIDERATE MANAGEMENT.	0	YELP
The staff are now not as friendly, the wait times for being served are horrible, no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes.	0	YELP
I won't be back.	0	YELP
They have great dinners.	1	YELP
The service was outshining & I definitely recommend the Halibut.	1	YELP
The food was terrible.	0	YELP
WILL NEVER EVER GO BACK AND HAVE TOLD MANY PEOPLE WHAT HAD HAPPENED.	0	YELP
I don't recommend unless your car breaks down in front of it and you are starving.	0	YELP
I will come back here every time I'm in Vegas.	1	YELP
This place deserves one star and 90% has to do with the food.	0	YELP
This is a disgrace.	0	YELP
Def coming back to bowl next time	1	YELP
If you want healthy authentic or ethic food, try this place.	1	YELP
I will continue to come here on ladies night andddd date night ... highly recommend this place to anyone who is in the area (;	1	YELP
I have been here several times in the past, and the experience has always been great.	1	YELP
We walked away stuffed and happy about our first Vegas buffet experience.	1	YELP
Service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is Vegas and located inside the Crystals shopping mall by Aria.	1	YELP
To summarize... the food was incredible, nay, transcendant... but nothing brings me joy quite like the memory of the pneumatic condiment dispenser.	1	YELP
I'm probably one of the few people to ever go to Ians and not like it.	0	YELP
Kids pizza is always a hit too with lots of great side dish options for the kiddos!	1	YELP
Service is perfect and the family atmosphere is nice to see.	1	YELP
Cooked to perfection and the service was impeccable.	1	YELP
This one is simply a disappointment.	0	YELP
Overall, I was very disappointed with the quality of food at Bouchon.	0	YELP
I don't have to be an accountant to know I'm getting screwed!	0	YELP
Great place to eat, reminds me of the little mom and pop shops in the San Francisco Bay Area.	1	YELP
Today was my first taste of a Buldogis Gourmet Hot Dog and I have to tell you it was more than I ever thought possible.	1	YELP
Left very frustrated.	0	YELP
I'll definitely be in soon again.	1	YELP
Food was really good and I got full petty fast.	1	YELP
Service was fantastic.	1	YELP
TOTAL WASTE OF TIME.	0	YELP
I don't know what kind it is but they have the best iced tea.	1	YELP
Come hungry, leave happy and stuffed!	1	YELP
For service, I give them no stars.	0	YELP
I can assure you that you won't be disappointed.	1	YELP
I can take a little bad service but the food sucks.	0	YELP
Gave up trying to eat any of the crust (teeth still sore).	0	YELP
But now I was completely grossed out.	0	YELP
I really enjoyed eating here.	1	YELP
First time going but I think I will quickly become a regular.	1	YELP
Our server was very nice, and even though he looked a little overwhelmed with all of our needs, he stayed professional and friendly until the end.	1	YELP
From what my dinner companions told me...everything was very fresh with nice texture and taste.	1	YELP
On the ground, right next to our table was a large, smeared, been-stepped-in-and-tracked-everywhere pile of green bird poop.	0	YELP
Furthermore, you can't even find hours of operation on the website!	0	YELP
We've tried to like this place but after 10+ times I think we're done with them.	0	YELP
What a mistake that was!	0	YELP
No complaints!	1	YELP
This is some seriously good pizza and I'm an expert/connisseur on the topic.	1	YELP
Waiter was a jerk.	0	YELP
Strike 2, who wants to be rushed.	0	YELP
These are the nicest restaurant owners I've ever come across.	1	YELP
I never come again.	0	YELP
We loved the biscuits!!!	1	YELP
Service is quick and friendly.	1	YELP
Ordered an appetizer and took 40 minutes and then the pizza another 10 minutes.	0	YELP
So absolutley fantastic.	1	YELP
It was a huge awkward 1.5lb piece of cow that was 3/4ths gristle and fat.	0	YELP
definitely will come back here again.	1	YELP
I like Steiners because it's dark and it feels like a bar.	1	YELP
Wow very spicy but delicious.	1	YELP
If you're not familiar, check it out.	1	YELP
I'll take my business dinner dollars elsewhere.	0	YELP
I'd love to go back.	1	YELP
Anyway, this FS restaurant has a wonderful breakfast/lunch.	1	YELP
Nothing special.	0	YELP
Each day of the week they have a different deal and it's all so delicious!	1	YELP
Not to mention the combination of pears, almonds and bacon is a big winner!	1	YELP
Will not be back.	0	YELP
Sauce was tasteless.	0	YELP
The food is delicious and just spicy enough, so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way.	1	YELP
My ribeye steak was cooked perfectly and had great mesquite flavor.	1	YELP
I don't think we'll be going back anytime soon.	0	YELP
Food was so gooodd.	1	YELP
I am far from a sushi connoisseur but I can definitely tell the difference between good food and bad food and this was certainly bad food.	0	YELP
I was so insulted.	0	YELP
The last 3 times I had lunch here has been bad.	0	YELP
The chicken wings contained the driest chicken meat I have ever eaten.	0	YELP
The food was very good and I enjoyed every mouthful, an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc.	1	YELP
Nargile - I think you are great.	1	YELP
Best tater tots in the southwest.	1	YELP
We loved the place.	1	YELP
Definitely not worth the $3 I paid.	0	YELP
The vanilla ice cream was creamy and smooth while the profiterole (choux) pastry was fresh enough.	1	YELP
Im in AZ all the time and now have my new spot.	1	YELP
The manager was the worst.	0	YELP
The inside is really quite nice and very clean.	1	YELP
The food was outstanding and the prices were very reasonable.	1	YELP
I don't think I'll be running back to Carly's anytime soon for food.	0	YELP
This is was due to the fact that it took 20 minutes to be acknowledged, then another 35 minutes to get our food...and they kept forgetting things.	0	YELP
Love the margaritas, too!	1	YELP
This was my first and only Vegas buffet and it did not disappoint.	1	YELP
Very good, though!	1	YELP
The one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading.	0	YELP
Great pork sandwich.	1	YELP
Don't waste your time here.	0	YELP
Total letdown, I would much rather just go to the Camelback Flower Shop and Cartel Coffee.	0	YELP
Third, the cheese on my friend's burger was cold.	0	YELP
We enjoy their pizza and brunch.	1	YELP
The steaks are all well trimmed and also perfectly cooked.	1	YELP
We had a group of 70+ when we claimed we would only have 40 and they handled us beautifully.	1	YELP
I LOVED it!	1	YELP
We asked for the bill to leave without eating and they didn't bring that either.	0	YELP
This place is a jewel in Las Vegas, and exactly what I've been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here.	1	YELP
Seafood was limited to boiled shrimp and crab legs but the crab legs definitely did not taste fresh.	0	YELP
The selection of food was not the best.	0	YELP
Delicious and I will absolutely be back!	1	YELP
This isn't a small family restaurant, this is a fine dining establishment.	1	YELP
They had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and I liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle.	1	YELP
I dont think I will be back for a very long time.	0	YELP
It was attached to a gas station, and that is rarely a good sign.	0	YELP
How awesome is that.	1	YELP
I will be back many times soon.	1	YELP
The menu had so much good stuff on it i could not decide!	1	YELP
Worse of all, he humiliated his worker right in front of me..Bunch of horrible name callings.	0	YELP
CONCLUSION: Very filling meals.	1	YELP
Their daily specials are always a hit with my group.	1	YELP
And then tragedy struck.	0	YELP
The pancake was also really good and pretty large at that.	1	YELP
This was my first crawfish experience, and it was delicious!	1	YELP
Their monster chicken fried steak and eggs is my all time favorite.	1	YELP
Waitress was sweet and funny.	1	YELP
I also had to taste my Mom's multi-grain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing, fluffy, and delicious!	1	YELP
I'd rather eat airline food, seriously.	0	YELP
Cant say enough good things about this place.	1	YELP
The ambiance was incredible.	1	YELP
The waitress and manager are so friendly.	1	YELP
I would not recommend this place.	0	YELP
Overall I wasn't very impressed with Noca.	0	YELP
My gyro was basically lettuce only.	0	YELP
Terrible service!	0	YELP
Thoroughly disappointed!	0	YELP
I don't each much pasta, but I love the homemade /hand made pastas and thin pizzas here.	1	YELP
Give it a try, you will be happy you did.	1	YELP
By far the BEST cheesecurds we have ever had!	1	YELP
Reasonably priced also!	1	YELP
Everything was perfect the night we were in.	1	YELP
The food is very good for your typical bar food.	1	YELP
it was a drive to get there.	0	YELP
At first glance it is a lovely bakery cafe - nice ambiance, clean, friendly staff.	1	YELP
Anyway, I do not think i will go back there.	0	YELP
Point your finger at any item on the menu, order it and you won't be disappointed.	1	YELP
Oh this is such a thing of beauty, this restaurant.	1	YELP
If you haven't gone here GO NOW!	1	YELP
A greasy, unhealthy meal.	0	YELP
first time there and might just be the last.	0	YELP
Those burgers were amazing.	1	YELP
Similarly, the delivery man did not say a word of apology when our food was 45 minutes late.	0	YELP
And it was way to expensive.	0	YELP
Be sure to order dessert, even if you need to pack it to-go - the tiramisu and cannoli are both to die for.	1	YELP
This was my first time and I can't wait until the next.	1	YELP
The bartender was also nice.	1	YELP
Everything was good and tasty!	1	YELP
This place is two thumbs up....way up.	1	YELP
The best place in Vegas for breakfast (just check out a Sat, or Sun.	1	YELP
If you love authentic Mexican food and want a whole bunch of interesting, yet delicious meats to choose from, you need to try this place.	1	YELP
Terrible management.	0	YELP
An excellent new restaurant by an experienced Frenchman.	1	YELP
If there were zero stars I would give it zero stars.	0	YELP
Great steak, great sides, great wine, amazing desserts.	1	YELP
Worst martini ever!	0	YELP
The steak and the shrimp are in my opinion the best entrees at GC.	1	YELP
I had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas!	1	YELP
We waited for thirty minutes to be seated (although there were 8 vacant tables and we were the only folks waiting).	0	YELP
The yellowtail carpaccio was melt in your mouth fresh.	1	YELP
I won't try going back there even if it's empty.	0	YELP
No, I'm going to eat the potato that I found some strangers hair in it.	0	YELP
Just spicy enough.. Perfect actually.	1	YELP
Last night was my second time dining here and I was so happy I decided to go back!	1	YELP
"not even a ""hello, we will be right with you."""	0	YELP
The desserts were a bit strange.	0	YELP
My boyfriend and I came here for the first time on a recent trip to Vegas and could not have been more pleased with the quality of food and service.	1	YELP
I really do recommend this place, you can go wrong with this donut place!	1	YELP
Nice ambiance.	1	YELP
I would recommend saving room for this!	1	YELP
I guess maybe we went on an off night but it was disgraceful.	0	YELP
However, my recent experience at this particular location was not so good.	0	YELP
I know this is not like the other restaurants at all, something is very off here!	0	YELP
AVOID THIS ESTABLISHMENT!	0	YELP
I think this restaurant suffers from not trying hard enough.	0	YELP
All of the tapas dishes were delicious!	1	YELP
I *heart* this place.	1	YELP
My salad had a bland vinegrette on the baby greens and hearts of Palm.	0	YELP
After two I felt disgusting.	0	YELP
A good time!	1	YELP
I believe that this place is a great stop for those with a huge belly and hankering for sushi.	1	YELP
Generous portions and great taste.	1	YELP
I will never go back to this place and will never ever recommended this place to anyone!	0	YELP
"The servers went back and forth several times, not even so much as an ""Are you being helped?"""	0	YELP
Food was delicious!	1	YELP
AN HOUR... seriously?	0	YELP
I consider this theft.	0	YELP
Eew... This location needs a complete overhaul.	0	YELP
We recently witnessed her poor quality of management towards other guests as well.	0	YELP
Waited and waited and waited.	0	YELP
He also came back to check on us regularly, excellent service.	1	YELP
Our server was super nice and checked on us many times.	1	YELP
The pizza tasted old, super chewy in not a good way.	0	YELP
I swung in to give them a try but was deeply disappointed.	0	YELP
Service was good and the company was better!	1	YELP
The staff are also very friendly and efficient.	1	YELP
As for the service: I'm a fan, because it's quick and you're being served by some nice folks.	1	YELP
Boy was that sucker dry!!.	0	YELP
Over rated.	0	YELP
If you look for authentic Thai food, go else where.	0	YELP
Their steaks are 100% recommended!	1	YELP
After I pulled up my car I waited for another 15 minutes before being acknowledged.	0	YELP
Great food and great service in a clean and friendly setting.	1	YELP
All in all, I can assure you I'll be back.	1	YELP
I hate those things as much as cheap quality black olives.	0	YELP
My breakfast was perpared great, with a beautiful presentation of 3 giant slices of Toast, lightly dusted with powdered sugar.	1	YELP
The kids play area is NASTY!	0	YELP
Great place fo take out or eat in.	1	YELP
The waitress was friendly and happy to accomodate for vegan/veggie options.	1	YELP
OMG I felt like I had never eaten Thai food until this dish.	1	YELP
"It was extremely ""crumby"" and pretty tasteless."	0	YELP
It was a pale color instead of nice and char and has NO flavor.	0	YELP
The croutons also taste homemade which is an extra plus.	1	YELP
I got home to see the driest damn wings ever!	0	YELP
It'll be a regular stop on my trips to Phoenix!	1	YELP
I really enjoyed Crema Café before they expanded; I even told friends they had the BEST breakfast.	1	YELP
Not good for the money.	0	YELP
I miss it and wish they had one in Philadelphia!	1	YELP
We got sitting fairly fast, but, ended up waiting 40 minutes just to place our order, another 30 minutes before the food arrived.	0	YELP
They also have the best cheese crisp in town.	1	YELP
Good value, great food, great service.	1	YELP
Couldn't ask for a more satisfying meal.	1	YELP
The food is good.	1	YELP
It was awesome.	1	YELP
I just wanted to leave.	0	YELP
We made the drive all the way from North Scottsdale... and I was not one bit disappointed!	1	YELP
I will not be eating there again.	0	YELP
!....THE OWNERS REALLY REALLY need to quit being soooooo cheap let them wrap my freaking sandwich in two papers not one!	0	YELP
I checked out this place a couple years ago and was not impressed.	0	YELP
The chicken I got was definitely reheated and was only ok, the wedges were cold and soggy.	0	YELP
Sorry, I will not be getting food from here anytime soon :(	0	YELP
An absolute must visit!	1	YELP
The cow tongue and cheek tacos are amazing.	1	YELP
My friend did not like his Bloody Mary.	0	YELP
Despite how hard I rate businesses, its actually rare for me to give a 1 star.	0	YELP
They really want to make your experience a good one.	1	YELP
I will not return.	0	YELP
I had the chicken Pho and it tasted very bland.	0	YELP
Very disappointing!!!	0	YELP
The grilled chicken was so tender and yellow from the saffron seasoning.	1	YELP
a drive thru means you do not want to wait around for half an hour for your food, but somehow when we end up going here they make us wait and wait.	0	YELP
Pretty awesome place.	1	YELP
Ambience is perfect.	1	YELP
Best of luck to the rude and non-customer service focused new management.	0	YELP
Any grandmother can make a roasted chicken better than this one.	0	YELP
I asked multiple times for the wine list and after some time of being ignored I went to the hostess and got one myself.	0	YELP
The staff is always super friendly and helpful, which is especially cool when you bring two small boys and a baby!	1	YELP
Four stars for the food & the guy in the blue shirt for his great vibe & still letting us in to eat !	1	YELP
The roast beef sandwich tasted really good!	1	YELP
Same evening, him and I are both drastically sick.	0	YELP
High-quality chicken on the chicken Caesar salad.	1	YELP
Ordered burger rare came in we'll done.	0	YELP
We were promptly greeted and seated.	1	YELP
Tried to go here for lunch and it was a madhouse.	0	YELP
I was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar, not only because the quality is great, but the service is fast and the food, impeccable.	1	YELP
After waiting an hour and being seated, I was not in the greatest of moods.	0	YELP
This is a good joint.	1	YELP
The Macarons here are insanely good.	1	YELP
I'm not eating here!	0	YELP
Our waiter was very attentive, friendly, and informative.	1	YELP
Maybe if they weren't cold they would have been somewhat edible.	0	YELP
This place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver.	0	YELP
Very bad Experience!	0	YELP
What a mistake.	0	YELP
Food was average at best.	0	YELP
Great food.	1	YELP
We won't be going back anytime soon!	0	YELP
Very Very Disappointed ordered the $35 Big Bay Plater.	0	YELP
Great place to relax and have an awesome burger and beer.	1	YELP
It is PERFECT for a sit-down family meal or get together with a few friends.	1	YELP
Not much flavor to them, and very poorly constructed.	0	YELP
The patio seating was very comfortable.	1	YELP
The fried rice was dry as well.	0	YELP
Hands down my favorite Italian restaurant!	1	YELP
"That just SCREAMS ""LEGIT"" in my book...somethat's also pretty rare here in Vegas."	1	YELP
It was just not a fun experience.	1	YELP
The atmosphere was great with a lovely duo of violinists playing songs we requested.	1	YELP
I personally love the hummus, pita, baklava, falafels and Baba Ganoush (it's amazing what they do with eggplant!).	1	YELP
Very convenient, since we were staying at the MGM!	1	YELP
The owners are super friendly and the staff is courteous.	1	YELP
Both great!	1	YELP
Eclectic selection.	1	YELP
The sweet potato tots were good but the onion rings were perfection or as close as I have had.	1	YELP
The staff was very attentive.	1	YELP
And the chef was generous with his time (even came around twice so we can take pictures with him).	1	YELP
The owner used to work at Nobu, so this place is really similar for half the price.	1	YELP
Google mediocre and I imagine Smashburger will pop up.	0	YELP
dont go here.	0	YELP
I promise they won't disappoint.	1	YELP
As a sushi lover avoid this place by all means.	0	YELP
What a great double cheeseburger!	1	YELP
Awesome service and food.	1	YELP
A fantastic neighborhood gem !!!	1	YELP
I can't wait to go back.	1	YELP
The plantains were the worst I've ever tasted.	0	YELP
It's a great place and I highly recommend it.	1	YELP
Service was slow and not attentive.	0	YELP
I gave it 5 stars then, and I'm giving it 5 stars now.	1	YELP
Your staff spends more time talking to themselves than me.	0	YELP
Dessert: Panna Cotta was amazing.	1	YELP
Very good food, great atmosphere.1	1	YELP
Damn good steak.	1	YELP
Total brunch fail.	0	YELP
Prices are very reasonable, flavors are spot on, the sauce is home made, and the slaw is not drenched in mayo.	1	YELP
The decor is nice, and the piano music soundtrack is pleasant.	1	YELP
The steak was amazing...rge fillet relleno was the best seafood plate i have ever had!	1	YELP
Good food , good service .	1	YELP
It was absolutely amazing.	1	YELP
I probably won't be back, to be honest.	0	YELP
will definitely be back!	1	YELP
The sergeant pepper beef sandwich with auju sauce is an excellent sandwich as well.	1	YELP
Hawaiian Breeze, Mango Magic, and Pineapple Delight are the smoothies that I've tried so far and they're all good.	1	YELP
Went for lunch - service was slow.	0	YELP
We had so much to say about the place before we walked in that he expected it to be amazing, but was quickly disappointed.	0	YELP
I was mortified.	0	YELP
Needless to say, we will never be back here again.	0	YELP
Anyways, The food was definitely not filling at all, and for the price you pay you should expect more.	0	YELP
The chips that came out were dripping with grease, and mostly not edible.	0	YELP
I wasn't really impressed with Strip Steak.	0	YELP
Have been going since 2007 and every meal has been awesome!!	1	YELP
Our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff.	1	YELP
The cashier was friendly and even brought the food out to me.	1	YELP
I work in the hospitality industry in Paradise Valley and have refrained from recommending Cibo any longer.	0	YELP
The atmosphere here is fun.	1	YELP
Would not recommend to others.	0	YELP
"Service is quick and even ""to go"" orders are just like we like it!"	1	YELP
I mean really, how do you get so famous for your fish and chips when it's so terrible!?!	0	YELP
That said, our mouths and bellies were still quite pleased.	1	YELP
Not my thing.	0	YELP
2 Thumbs Up!!	1	YELP
If you are reading this please don't go there.	0	YELP
I loved the grilled pizza, reminded me of legit Italian pizza.	1	YELP
Only Pros : Large seating area/ Nice bar area/ Great simple drink menu/ The BEST brick oven pizza with homemade dough!	1	YELP
They have a really nice atmosphere.	1	YELP
Tonight I had the Elk Filet special...and it sucked.	0	YELP
After one bite, I was hooked.	1	YELP
We ordered some old classics and some new dishes after going there a few times and were sorely disappointed with everything.	0	YELP
Cute, quaint, simple, honest.	1	YELP
The chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside.	1	YELP
The food was great as always, compliments to the chef.	1	YELP
Special thanks to Dylan T. for the recommendation on what to order :) All yummy for my tummy.	1	YELP
Awesome selection of beer.	1	YELP
Great food and awesome service!	1	YELP
One nice thing was that they added gratuity on the bill since our party was larger than 6 or 8, and they didn't expect more tip than that.	1	YELP
A FLY was in my apple juice.. A FLY!!!!!!!!	0	YELP
The Han Nan Chicken was also very tasty.	1	YELP
As for the service, I thought it was good.	1	YELP
The food was barely lukewarm, so it must have been sitting waiting for the server to bring it out to us.	0	YELP
Ryan's Bar is definitely one Edinburgh establishment I won't be revisiting.	0	YELP
Nicest Chinese restaurant I've been in a while.	1	YELP
Overall, I like there food and the service.	1	YELP
They also now serve Indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world.	1	YELP
Probably never coming back, and wouldn't recommend it.	0	YELP
Friend's pasta -- also bad, he barely touched it.	0	YELP
Try them in the airport to experience some tasty food and speedy, friendly service.	1	YELP
I love the decor with the Chinese calligraphy wall paper.	1	YELP
Never had anything to complain about here.	1	YELP
The restaurant is very clean and has a family restaurant feel to it.	1	YELP
It was way over fried.	0	YELP
I'm not sure how long we stood there but it was long enough for me to begin to feel awkwardly out of place.	0	YELP
When I opened the sandwich, I was impressed, but not in a good way.	0	YELP
Will not be back!	0	YELP
There was a warm feeling with the service and I felt like their guest for a special treat.	1	YELP
An extensive menu provides lots of options for breakfast.	1	YELP
I always order from the vegetarian menu during dinner, which has a wide array of options to choose from.	1	YELP
I have watched their prices inflate, portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly!	0	YELP
Wonderful lil tapas and the ambience made me feel all warm and fuzzy inside.	1	YELP
I got to enjoy the seafood salad, with a fabulous vinegrette.	1	YELP
The wontons were thin, not thick and chewy, almost melt in your mouth.	1	YELP
Level 5 spicy was perfect, where spice didn't over-whelm the soup.	1	YELP
We were sat right on time and our server from the get go was FANTASTIC!	1	YELP
Main thing I didn't enjoy is that the crowd is of older crowd, around mid 30s and up.	0	YELP
When I'm on this side of town, this will definitely be a spot I'll hit up again!	1	YELP
I had to wait over 30 minutes to get my drink and longer to get 2 arepas.	0	YELP
This is a GREAT place to eat!	1	YELP
The jalapeno bacon is soooo good.	1	YELP
The service was poor and thats being nice.	0	YELP
Food was good, service was good, Prices were good.	1	YELP
The place was not clean and the food oh so stale!	0	YELP
The chicken dishes are OK, the beef is like shoe leather.	0	YELP
But the service was beyond bad.	0	YELP
"I'm so happy to be here!!!"""	1	YELP
Tasted like dirt.	0	YELP
One of the few places in Phoenix that I would definately go back to again .	1	YELP
The block was amazing.	1	YELP
It's close to my house, it's low-key, non-fancy, affordable prices, good food.	1	YELP
* Both the Hot & Sour & the Egg Flower Soups were absolutely 5 Stars!	1	YELP
My sashimi was poor quality being soggy and tasteless.	0	YELP
Great time - family dinner on a Sunday night.	1	YELP
"the food is not tasty at all, not to say its ""real traditional Hunan style""."	0	YELP
What did bother me, was the slow service.	0	YELP
The flair bartenders are absolutely amazing!	1	YELP
Their frozen margaritas are WAY too sugary for my taste.	0	YELP
These were so good we ordered them twice.	1	YELP
So in a nutshell: 1) The restaraunt smells like a combination of a dirty fish market and a sewer.	0	YELP
My girlfriend's veal was very bad.	0	YELP
Unfortunately, it was not good.	0	YELP
I had a pretty satifying experience.	1	YELP
Join the club and get awesome offers via email.	1	YELP
Perfect for someone (me) who only likes beer ice cold, or in this case, even colder.	1	YELP
Bland and flavorless is a good way of describing the barely tepid meat.	0	YELP
The chains, which I'm no fan of, beat this place easily.	0	YELP
The nachos are a MUST HAVE!	1	YELP
We will not be coming back.	0	YELP
I don't have very many words to say about this place, but it does everything pretty well.	1	YELP
The staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries, lawyers, and court staff.	1	YELP
Great atmosphere, friendly and fast service.	1	YELP
When I received my Pita it was huge it did have a lot of meat in it so thumbs up there.	1	YELP
Once your food arrives it's meh.	0	YELP
Paying $7.85 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kid's meal at the Wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal.	0	YELP
The classic Maine Lobster Roll was fantastic.	1	YELP
My brother in law who works at the mall ate here same day, and guess what he was sick all night too.	0	YELP
So good I am going to have to review this place twice - once hereas a tribute to the place and once as a tribute to an event held here last night.	1	YELP
The chips and salsa were really good, the salsa was very fresh.	1	YELP
This place is great!!!!!!!!!!!!!!	1	YELP
Mediocre food.	0	YELP
Once you get inside you'll be impressed with the place.	1	YELP
I'm super pissd.	0	YELP
And service was super friendly.	1	YELP
Why are these sad little vegetables so overcooked?	0	YELP
This place was such a nice surprise!	1	YELP
They were golden-crispy and delicious.	1	YELP
I had high hopes for this place since the burgers are cooked over a charcoal grill, but unfortunately the taste fell flat, way flat.	0	YELP
I could eat their bruschetta all day it is devine.	1	YELP
Not a single employee came out to see if we were OK or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food.	0	YELP
Lastly, the mozzarella sticks, they were the best thing we ordered.	1	YELP
The first time I ever came here I had an amazing experience, I still tell people how awesome the duck was.	1	YELP
The server was very negligent of our needs and made us feel very unwelcome... I would not suggest this place!	0	YELP
The service was terrible though.	0	YELP
This place is overpriced, not consistent with their boba, and it really is OVERPRICED!	0	YELP
It was packed!!	0	YELP
I love this place.	1	YELP
I can say that the desserts were yummy.	1	YELP
The food was terrible.	0	YELP
The seasonal fruit was fresh white peach puree.	1	YELP
It kept getting worse and worse so now I'm officially done.	0	YELP
This place should honestly be blown up.	0	YELP
But I definitely would not eat here again.	0	YELP
Do not waste your money here!	0	YELP
I love that they put their food in nice plastic containers as opposed to cramming it in little paper takeout boxes.	1	YELP
The crêpe was delicate and thin and moist.	1	YELP
Awful service.	0	YELP
Won't ever go here again.	0	YELP
Food quality has been horrible.	0	YELP
For that price I can think of a few place I would have much rather gone.	0	YELP
The service here is fair at best.	0	YELP
I do love sushi, but I found Kabuki to be over-priced, over-hip and under-services.	0	YELP
Do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish.	0	YELP
Very poor service.	0	YELP
No one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it.	0	YELP
Best service and food ever, Maria our server was so good and friendly she made our day.	1	YELP
They were excellent.	1	YELP
I paid the bill but did not tip because I felt the server did a terrible job.	0	YELP
Just had lunch here and had a great experience.	1	YELP
I have never had such bland food which surprised me considering the article we read focused so much on their spices and flavor.	0	YELP
Food is way overpriced and portions are fucking small.	0	YELP
I recently tried Caballero's and I have been back every week since!	1	YELP
for 40 bucks a head, i really expect better food.	0	YELP
The food came out at a good pace.	1	YELP
I ate there twice on my last visit, and especially enjoyed the salmon salad.	1	YELP
I won't be back.	0	YELP
We could not believe how dirty the oysters were!	0	YELP
This place deserves no stars.	0	YELP
I would not recommend this place.	0	YELP
In fact I'm going to round up to 4 stars, just because she was so awesome.	1	YELP
To my disbelief, each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods I have ever tasted.	0	YELP
Bad day or not, I have a very low tolerance for rude customer service people, it is your job to be nice and polite, wash dishes otherwise!!	0	YELP
the potatoes were great and so was the biscuit.	1	YELP
I probably would not go here again.	0	YELP
So flavorful and has just the perfect amount of heat.	1	YELP
The price is reasonable and the service is great.	1	YELP
The Wife hated her meal (coconut shrimp), and our friends really did not enjoy their meals, either.	0	YELP
My fella got the huevos rancheros and they didn't look too appealing.	0	YELP
Went in for happy hour, great list of wines.	1	YELP
Some may say this buffet is pricey but I think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot!	1	YELP
I probably won't be coming back here.	0	YELP
Worst food/service I've had in a while.	0	YELP
This place is pretty good, nice little vibe in the restaurant.	1	YELP
Talk about great customer service of course we will be back.	1	YELP
Hot dishes are not hot, cold dishes are close to room temp.I watched staff prepare food with BARE HANDS, no gloves.Everything is deep fried in oil.	0	YELP
I love their fries and their beans.	1	YELP
Always a pleasure dealing with him.	1	YELP
They have a plethora of salads and sandwiches, and everything I've tried gets my seal of approval.	1	YELP
This place is awesome if you want something light and healthy during the summer.	1	YELP
For sushi on the Strip, this is the place to go.	1	YELP
The service was great, even the manager came and helped with our table.	1	YELP
The feel of the dining room was more college cooking course than high class dining and the service was slow at best.	0	YELP
I started this review with two stars, but I'm editing it to give it only one.	0	YELP
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides Costco's.	0	YELP
All in all an excellent restaurant highlighted by great service, a unique menu, and a beautiful setting.	1	YELP
My boyfriend and i sat at the bar and had a completely delightful experience.	1	YELP
Weird vibe from owners.	0	YELP
There was hardly any meat.	0	YELP
I've had better bagels from the grocery store.	0	YELP
Go To Place for Gyros.	1	YELP
I love the owner/chef, his one authentic Japanese cool dude!	1	YELP
Now the burgers aren't as good, the pizza which used to be amazing is doughy and flavorless.	0	YELP
I found a six inch long piece of wire in my salsa.	0	YELP
The service was terrible, food was mediocre.	0	YELP
We definately enjoyed ourselves.	1	YELP
I ordered Albondigas soup - which was just warm - and tasted like tomato soup with frozen meatballs.	0	YELP
On three different occasions I asked for well done or medium well, and all three times I got the bloodiest piece of meat on my plate.	0	YELP
I had about two bites and refused to eat anymore.	0	YELP
The service was extremely slow.	0	YELP
After 20 minutes wait, I got a table.	0	YELP
Seriously killer hot chai latte.	1	YELP
No allergy warnings on the menu, and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts.	0	YELP
My boyfriend tried the Mediterranean Chicken Salad and fell in love.	1	YELP
Their rotating beers on tap is also a highlight of this place.	1	YELP
Pricing is a bit of a concern at Mellow Mushroom.	0	YELP
Worst Thai ever.	0	YELP
If you stay in Vegas you must get breakfast here at least once.	1	YELP
I want to first say our server was great and we had perfect service.	1	YELP
The pizza selections are good.	1	YELP
I had strawberry tea, which was good.	1	YELP
Highly unprofessional and rude to a loyal patron!	0	YELP
Overall, a great experience.	1	YELP
Spend your money elsewhere.	0	YELP
Their regular toasted bread was equally satisfying with the occasional pats of butter... Mmmm...!	1	YELP
The Buffet at Bellagio was far from what I anticipated.	0	YELP
And the drinks are WEAK, people!	0	YELP
-My order was not correct.	0	YELP
Also, I feel like the chips are bought, not made in house.	0	YELP
After the disappointing dinner we went elsewhere for dessert.	0	YELP
The chips and sals a here is amazing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!	1	YELP
We won't be returning.	0	YELP
This is my new fav Vegas buffet spot.	1	YELP
I seriously cannot believe that the owner has so many unexperienced employees that all are running around like chickens with their heads cut off.	0	YELP
Very, very sad.	0	YELP
i felt insulted and disrespected, how could you talk and judge another human being like that?	0	YELP
How can you call yourself a steakhouse if you can't properly cook a steak, I don't understand!	0	YELP
I'm not impressed with the concept or the food.	0	YELP
The only thing I wasn't too crazy about was their guacamole as I don't like it puréed.	0	YELP
There is really nothing for me at postinos, hope your experience is better	0	YELP
I got food poisoning here at the buffet.	0	YELP
They brought a fresh batch of fries and I was thinking yay something warm but no!	0	YELP
What SHOULD have been a hilarious, yummy Christmas Eve dinner to remember was the biggest fail of the entire trip for us.	0	YELP
Needless to say, I won't be going back anytime soon.	0	YELP
This place is disgusting!	0	YELP
Every time I eat here, I see caring teamwork to a professional degree.	1	YELP
The RI style calamari was a joke.	0	YELP
However, there was so much garlic in the fondue, it was barely edible.	0	YELP
I could barely stomach the meal, but didn't complain because it was a business lunch.	0	YELP
It was so bad, I had lost the heart to finish it.	0	YELP
It also took her forever to bring us the check when we asked for it.	0	YELP
We aren't ones to make a scene at restaurants but I just don't get it...definitely lost the love after this one!	0	YELP
Disappointing experience.	0	YELP
The food is about on par with Denny's, which is to say, not good at all.	0	YELP
If you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service, then this is the place for you.	0	YELP
WAAAAAAyyyyyyyyyy over rated is all I am saying.	0	YELP
We won't be going back.	0	YELP
The place was fairly clean but the food simply wasn't worth it.	0	YELP
This place lacked style!!	0	YELP
The sangria was about half of a glass wine full and was $12, ridiculous.	0	YELP
Don't bother coming here.	0	YELP
The meat was pretty dry, I had the sliced brisket and pulled pork.	0	YELP
The building itself seems pretty neat; the bathroom is pretty trippy, but I wouldn't eat here again.	0	YELP
It was equally awful.	0	YELP
Probably not in a hurry to go back.	0	YELP
very slow at seating even with reservation.	0	YELP
Not good by any stretch of the imagination.	0	YELP
The cashew cream sauce was bland and the vegetables were undercooked.	0	YELP
The chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless, seemed thin and watered down with no heat.	0	YELP
It was a bit too sweet, not really spicy enough, and lacked flavor.	0	YELP
I was VERY disappointed!!	0	YELP
This place is horrible and way overpriced.	0	YELP
Maybe it's just their Vegetarian fare, but I've been twice and I thought it was average at best.	0	YELP
It wasn't busy at all and now we know why.	0	YELP
The tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu.	0	YELP
The ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting, but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits.	0	YELP
Con: spotty service.	0	YELP
The fries were not hot, and neither was my burger.	0	YELP
But then they came back cold.	0	YELP
Then our food came out, disappointment ensued.	0	YELP
The real disappointment was our waiter.	0	YELP
My husband said she was very rude... did not even apologize for the bad food or anything.	0	YELP
The only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach.	0	YELP
Insults, profound deuchebaggery, and had to go outside for a smoke break while serving just to solidify it.	0	YELP
If someone orders two tacos don't' you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart?	0	YELP
She was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door.	0	YELP
After all the rave reviews I couldn't wait to eat here......what a disappointment!	0	YELP
Del Taco is pretty nasty and should be avoided if possible.	0	YELP
It's NOT hard to make a decent hamburger.	0	YELP
But I don't like it.	0	YELP
Hell no will I go back	0	YELP
We've have gotten a much better service from the pizza place next door than the services we received from this restaurant.	0	YELP
"I don't know what the big deal is about this place, but I won't be back ""ya'all""."	0	YELP
I immediately said I wanted to talk to the manager but I did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar.	0	YELP
The ambiance isn't much better.	0	YELP
Unfortunately, it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees.	0	YELP
The food wasn't good.	0	YELP
Your servers suck, wait, correction, our server Heimer sucked.	0	YELP
What happened next was pretty....off putting.	0	YELP
too bad cause I know it's family owned, I really wanted to like this place.	0	YELP
Overpriced for what you are getting.	0	YELP
I vomited in the bathroom mid lunch.	0	YELP
I kept looking at the time and it had soon become 35 minutes, yet still no food.	0	YELP
I have been to very few places to eat that under no circumstances would I ever return to, and this tops the list.	0	YELP
We started with the tuna sashimi which was brownish in color and obviously wasn't fresh.	0	YELP
Food was below average.	0	YELP
It sure does beat the nachos at the movies but I would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant.	0	YELP
All in all, Ha Long Bay was a bit of a flop.	0	YELP
The problem I have is that they charge $11.99 for a sandwich that is no bigger than a Subway sub (which offers better and more amount of vegetables).	0	YELP
Shrimp- When I unwrapped it (I live only 1/2 a mile from Brushfire) it was literally ice cold.	0	YELP
It lacked flavor, seemed undercooked, and dry.	0	YELP
It really is impressive that the place hasn't closed down.	0	YELP
I would avoid this place if you are staying in the Mirage.	0	YELP
The refried beans that came with my meal were dried out and crusty and the food was bland.	0	YELP
Spend your money and time some place else.	0	YELP
A lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar In her salad.	0	YELP
the presentation of the food was awful.	0	YELP
I can't tell you how disappointed I was.	0	YELP
I think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking.	0	YELP
Appetite instantly gone.	0	YELP
Overall I was not impressed and would not go back.	0	YELP
The whole experience was underwhelming, and I think we'll just go to Ninja Sushi next time.	0	YELP
Then, as if I hadn't wasted enough of my life there, they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check.	0	YELP
