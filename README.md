# Projects Description

Each nested folder in this repository contains a separate ML / Deep Learning project that aims to solve a particular problem by developing a model. Details of the projects are described in the respective subfulders.

Data mostly comes from Kaggle data sets and some other publicly available resources. Links to my Kaggle notebooks are available for projects that are duplicated here from their original implementation.
